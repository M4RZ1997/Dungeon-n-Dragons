\entryfont \noindent \DndDropCapLine{A} fearsome reptilian abomination, the Toxicore Basilisk possesses a bionic appearance with scales resembling polished steel. These metallic plates reflect light in a mesmerizing display, giving the creature an otherworldly, almost mechanical aura. Its massive form, accentuated by a vivid green hue that seems to pulsate with an eerie glow, instills both awe and dread in those who behold it.
\paragraph{Toxic Emanation} Known throughout the land for its toxic nature, the Toxicore Basilisk has the unique ability to generate a highly potent black ichor. This toxic substance not only eats away at the very fabric of the environment, leaving a trail of decay and corruption, but also possesses hazardous properties that pose a grave threat to any living beings it touches. The mere proximity to this creature can leave a lasting impact, its very presence tainting the air with darkness.

\paragraph{Lethal Variations} Within the Toxicore Basilisk species, two distinct adult variations exist, each with its own terrifying attributes. The first variation, often referred to as the Bladed Basilisk, resembles a nightmarish fusion of a Tyrannosaurus and an insect. Jagged and imposing blades extend from its body and head, serving as deadly weapons that strike fear into the hearts of its adversaries. With a lightning-fast charge, the Bladed Basilisk unleashes a barrage of devastating attacks, utilizing its razor-sharp blades to slice through even the toughest defenses.

In stark contrast, the second variant, known as the Insectoid Basilisk, takes on the form of a massive insect with an elongated body. Its steel-like exoskeleton glistens with an uncanny sheen, while scythe-like appendages extend from its head and limbs. Agile and nimble, the Insectoid Basilisk swiftly maneuvers across the battlefield, delivering precise and lethal strikes with its deadly scythes. It leaves behind a trail of devastation, deep wounds marking its path.

Even in its infant stage, the Toxicore Basilisk commands attention. Known as the Toxicore Hatchling Salamanderids, these young creatures bear the resemblance of salamanders, yet possess insect-like mandibles on their heads. Though not as developed as their adult counterparts, these hatchlings display remarkable tenacity and a penchant for delivering painful bites. They possess an instinctual ability to defend themselves, ensuring their survival from an early age.

\paragraph{Unyielding Dread} Protected by its formidable steel-like scales, the Toxicore Basilisk presents an imposing challenge for any who dare to face it. Its toxic abilities, coupled with its lethal prowess and bionic appearance, make it a force to be reckoned with. Legends and cautionary tales abound, warning of the devastation left in the wake of this monstrous creature's path.

\subsection*{Legendary Actions}
Vishgraz can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Vishgraz regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
\paragraph{Toxic Spew} Vishgraz targets a point it can see within 60 feet of it. The area becomes heavily obscured in a 20-foot radius until the end of Vishgraz's next turn. Each creature that starts its turn in that area takes \DndDice{3d6} poison damage.
\paragraph{Terrifying Gaze} Vishgraz fixes its gaze on a creature within 30 feet of it that can see it. If the target can see the basilisk's eyes, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Terrifying Gaze of all Toxicore Basilisks for the next 24 hours.
\paragraph{Tail Sweep (Costs 2 Actions)} Vishgraz sweeps its tail in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

\subsection*{Lair Actions}
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Vishgraz takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The area becomes filled with a thick toxic mist, creating heavily obscured conditions. Each creature that is not a Toxicore Basilisk must make a DC18 Constitution Saving Throw or is poisoned for 1 minute.
	\item Poisonous vines erupt from the ground, creating difficult terrain. Each creature that is not a Toxicore Basilisk must make a DC16 Constitution Saving Throw or is poisoned for 1 minute.
	\item  The ambient temperature rises dramatically, causing all creatures in the area to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take \DndDice{4d6} fire damage.
\end{itemize}
