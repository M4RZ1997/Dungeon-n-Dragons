\itemDescriptionAndImage{Armor (Chain Shirt, Medium), Rare}{Chain_Shirt_of_the_Sun.png}{10.25cm}
\section*{Appearance}
The Chain Shirt of the Sun is a dazzling piece of armor crafted from fine, golden links that glimmer like rays of sunlight. The chainmail is masterfully woven, each link appearing to catch and hold light, giving the armor an almost ethereal glow. Across the chest, an intricate emblem of a radiant golden-red sun is seamlessly integrated into the weave of the chain links.

The chain shirt's design is elegant yet functional, its flexible structure allowing for ease of movement while still providing excellent protection. The hem and edges are reinforced with delicate golden threading that creates subtle, swirling patterns resembling the flow of solar winds. When worn, the chain shirt emits a soft warmth, as if imbued with the gentle heat of the midday sun.

Tiny, faintly glowing runes are etched into some of the links, nearly imperceptible unless viewed closely. These runes pulse faintly with a golden hue, a testament to the divine and magical craftsmanship that forged the chain shirt. The overall effect is both majestic and intimidating, a perfect blend of beauty and power that marks the wearer as a champion of light.

\section*{History}
The Chain Shirt of the Sun is a masterpiece of magical craftsmanship, forged to serve as the ceremonial and functional armor for the wizards of the Radiant Guard, an ancient order devoted to the solar deity Horus Re. This radiant chainmail is not only a symbol of the Guard's devotion but also a powerful artifact imbued with divine magic to aid in their sacred mission of justice and protection.

Its origins trace back to the collaboration between the Radiant Guard and an enclave of elven master smiths from the sunlit forests of Ilyrien Vale. The elves, renowned for their expertise in creating enchanted armors like the legendary Elven Chain, shared their secrets of forging flexible, lightweight, and magically imbued chainmail. With the blessing of Horus Re, the elves worked alongside the Radiant Guard's priests and arcanists to create an armor that could resonate with the sun god's divine essence.

The first Chain Shirt of the Sun was presented to the leader of the Radiant Guard centuries ago, marking a new era of cooperation between the elves and the followers of Horus Re. Over time, these chain shirts became the defining symbol of the Guard's wizard ranks. Unlike heavier plate armor, which would hinder a wizard's spellcasting, the chain shirt was designed to be light, flexible, and attuned to magic, allowing its wearer to harness both arcane and divine power seamlessly.
