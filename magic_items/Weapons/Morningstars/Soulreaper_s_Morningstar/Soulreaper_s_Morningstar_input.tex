\itemDescriptionAndImage{Weapon, Morningstar, rare (requires attunement)}{Soulreaper_s_Morningstar.png}{9.75cm}\\

\section*{Appearance}
The Soulreaper's Morningstar is a masterful amalgamation of dark magic and medieval warfare, designed to strike terror into the hearts of those who face it. Its handle is crafted from a dense, shadowy wood that seems to absorb light, giving it an almost ethereal quality. Roughly the length of an arm, it provides the wielder with ample reach and control.

The air around the flail seems to throb with power, as if the weapon itself were alive with a malevolent will. Whispers of dark energy emanate from it, forming ghostly arcs of light that dance around the weapon in an eerie display of its connection to the otherworldly realms.

\section*{History}
The creation of the morningstar was marked by rituals lost to time, performed in a hidden forge that was said to lie at the crossroads between the world of the living and the realm of the dead. The materials used in its construction were sourced from the darkest corners of the world: wood from the Tree of Woe, known to grow where no light ever shines, and metal smelted in the flames of the Underworld itself.

As the final touch, the Soulreaper's essence was bound to the weapon, granting it not only unparalleled power but also a sinister will of its own. The entity's whispers became a constant presence for each of its wielders, offering cryptic guidance and urging them towards ever darker deeds.

Legends tell of many battles and epic confrontations in which the morningstar unleashed a cataclysmic explosion of dark energy. Whenever the dust settles, only the morningstar remains on the scourges of the battlefield.

In the centuries that followed, the Soulreaper's Morningstar passed through the hands of many, always seeking a wielder with the ambition to wield its power and the will to resist its corrupting influence. Its history is a tapestry of triumph and tragedy, with each chapter written in the blood of those who dared to harness its dark might.

\section*{Magical Effects}
\textit{Versatile (1d10)} - Garen can wield Soulreaper's Morningstar with two hands to deal additional damage (1d10) instead of the usual 1d8.
\subsection*{Soulreaper's Embrace}\hfill\\
Once per long rest, when Garen lands a critical hit against a creature, he can invoke Soulreaper's Embrace. On that attack, the morningstar deals an additional 2d6 necrotic damage, as the dark essence of the entity within courses through his strike.
\subsection*{Eldritch Connection}\hfill\\
As Garen's pact weapon, Soulreaper's Morningstar counts as a spellcasting focus for his Warlock spells. Additionally, while attuned to the morningstar, he gains a +1 bonus to his Warlock spell attack rolls and spell save DC.
\subsection*{Personality and Influence}\hfill\\
The morningstar carries the essence of an ancient entity known as Soulreaper. While Garen remains in control of the morningstar, the entity's whispers and presence are ever-present. It provides cryptic visions and insights into the unknown, but also seeks to nudge Garen towards darker paths. The Dwarf's willpower and sense of duty have thus far prevented Soulreaper from overtaking him, but the struggle continues.
