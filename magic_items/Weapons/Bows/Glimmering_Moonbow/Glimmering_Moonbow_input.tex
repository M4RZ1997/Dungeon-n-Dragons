\section*{Appearance}
The Glimmering Moonbow is a masterpiece of arcane craftsmanship, forged from silver-black metal that gleams with an otherworldly sheen. Its slender frame is delicately engraved with the phases of the moon, each glowing faintly with an ethereal silver light, as though imbued with lunar magic. Designed to be both elegant and functional, this bow emanates an aura of mystery and power.

Light dances across its reflective surface, accentuating its celestial motifs, while its supple curves and precise construction suggest unparalleled accuracy. The Glimmering Moonbow is a weapon of legend, capable of harnessing the moon's phases to empower its wielder's arrows, making it a coveted treasure for those who seek balance between finesse and raw arcane potency.

\section*{History}
The origins of the Glimmering Moonbow trace back to the Age of Arcanum, where it was crafted by a reclusive elven artisan known as Silvarion Lunathil. Renowned for blending intricate magic with masterful metallurgy, Silvarion created the bow as a tribute to Sel√ªne, the goddess of the moon. It was said to channel lunar energy, enhancing its wielder's precision and imbuing their arrows with magical effects tied to the phases of the moon.

The bow was lost during the Calamity, when Silvarion's workshop fell to ruin in the chaos of warring deities and mortal struggles. For centuries, it became the subject of myths, rumored to rest in a hidden vault guarded by ancient wards and lunar constructs. Adventurers searched tirelessly, but the bow eluded discovery, becoming a tale of legend passed down through generations.

It wasn't until an expedition led by the Lantan Ranger Corps - a highly skilled group of scouts - uncovered its resting place that the bow resurfaced. Buried within the remains of a crumbling, gear-filled temple deep in the Moonshae Isles, the Moonbow was carefully extracted and restored. The Corps, recognizing its historical significance and magical potency, preserved the artifact, ensuring its story and craftsmanship would endure for future generations.

The Glimmering Moonbow remains a testament to the ingenuity of past ages, now wielded sparingly by the Corps' most accomplished archers during moments of great peril.

\section*{Magic}
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you hit with a ranged attack roll using this magic bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage. If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you make a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

While wielding this magic bow, you can use a bonus action to enter a semi-incorporeal state until the start of your next turn. While semi-incorporeal, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once this bonus action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
