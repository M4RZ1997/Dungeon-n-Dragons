\section*{Appearance}
The Spear of the Green is a remarkable weapon, exuding an ancient and mystical aura. Its shaft is crafted from a rare, dark wood that seems to absorb the light around it, giving the weapon an almost ethereal quality. The wood is smooth and cool to the touch, inlaid with intricate silver filigree that spirals up towards the spearhead. This filigree work is delicate and seems to depict a variety of forest scenes, with leaves, vines, and the occasional small animal hidden within its design.

At the spear's head, the metal is unlike any other; it gleams with a soft, greenish hue that suggests it was forged not from iron or steel but from some magical mineral. The spearhead itself is leaf-shaped, broad and thin, honed to a razor's edge on both sides. It seems to shimmer slightly in the light, as if it were not entirely solid, giving the impression of a blade made from condensed forest mist.

\section*{History}
The Spear of the Green is shrouded in legends that trace back to the earliest days of the world, when magic flowed freely and the boundary between the earthly and the ethereal was thin. It is said to have been crafted by the ancient Druids, guardians of nature, who sought to create a weapon that could protect the balance of life. Forged in a ritual that harnessed the essence of the primordial forest, the spear was imbued with the strength of ancient trees and the wisdom of the earth itself.

Throughout the ages, the Spear of the Green has been wielded by heroes chosen for their pure hearts and unwavering dedication to the natural world. It played pivotal roles in battles that are now the stuff of legend, always appearing at times when the balance between nature and civilization was threatened.

The spear's last known bearer was a ranger named Elarion, who vanished into the mists of the Enchanted Forest centuries ago, defending the realms against a darkness that sought to engulf the world. Since then, the Spear of the Green has been lost to myth, waiting for a new champion to claim its power and continue the eternal vigil over the natural order.

\section*{Magic}
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you cast a paladin spell with a target of Self, you can't lose concentration on the spell from taking damage. This bonus increases to +2 at level 10 and +3 at level 17.\\
While you hold the drawn spear, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that aura gain resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.
