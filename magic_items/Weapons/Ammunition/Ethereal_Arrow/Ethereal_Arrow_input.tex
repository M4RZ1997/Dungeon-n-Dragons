\section*{History}

The Ethereal Arrow has a storied history steeped in ancient magic and legendary craftsmanship. It was developed by the formidable Storm Giants, known for their mastery over elemental forces, with the assistance of Laucian Ilphelkiir, a renowned wood elf ranger. The creation of this magical ammunition was driven by the need for a weapon effective underwater, where common arrows failed.

Laucian's expertise in archery and arcane energies was crucial in the development process. The shaft, made from sacred copper and bronze, was crafted to channel immense magical energies. Laucian meticulously etched intricate arcane runes, granting the arrow its signature teleportation abilities. The arrowhead, resembling pure lightning, was imbued with the essence of storms, while the fletchings, glowing in electric blue, were composed of radiant energy, enhancing its flight.

The Ethereal Arrow stands as a testament to the extraordinary collaboration between the Storm Giants and Laucian Ilphelkiir, embodying a fusion of ancient magic and advanced craftsmanship. It remains a revered weapon, prized for its unparalleled power and historical significance.

\section*{Magic}

Upon being shot, the Ethereal Arrow immediately blinks out of the Material Plane and into the Ethereal Plane. It travels through this spectral realm, bypassing obstacles and defenses that exist only in the Material Plane. Just moments before hitting its intended target, the arrow re-materializes in the Material Plane, striking with uncanny precision. This effect allows the arrow to ignore cover and barriers, ensuring a direct hit on the target.
