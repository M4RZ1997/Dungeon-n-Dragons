\section*{\hspace*{4cm}Appearance}
The "Rapier of Life Stealing" is a weapon of formidable beauty and dark allure. Its slender, elegantly crafted blade stretches gracefully, tapering to a fine point designed for precision. The metal of the blade possesses an otherworldly sheen, reflecting hues of ominous blacks and deep purples, as if absorbing the very light around it.

Enveloping the blade, ethereal lightning bolts dance in a mesmerizing display of power. These are not ordinary sparks but manifestations of necrotic energy, shimmering in hues of sinister green and vibrant purple, crackling with the promise of life force to be siphoned from its victims.

The rapier's hilt is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, featuring intricate designs that hint at its ancient and mystical origins. It might bear symbols or sigils associated with necromancy or the vampire lore, paying homage to its wielder, the true vampire Azriel, the Count of Zhalfirim. The grip is wrapped in a material that looks like black leather, offering a firm hold, while the crossguard and pommel are adorned with precious stones, emphasizing its status as a weapon of high nobility.

\section*{History}
The "Rapier of Life Stealing" is not merely a weapon; it's a relic with a history as dark and intriguing as its appearance. Forged in the depths of the Underworld by a cabal of necromancers, it was created during the eclipse of the Blood Moon, which is said to empower objects with the essence of life and death. The rapier's blade was cooled in the blood of a vampire lord, giving it its necrotic abilities and the unique property of sizzling with green and purple lightning bolts, a visual manifestation of its power to siphon life force.

Over centuries, the rapier has been instrumental in shaping the fate of empires and the lives of many. It is rumored that each soul claimed by the rapier adds to its strength and to the longevity of its wielder. Legends speak of duels where the weapon's blade cut through magical barriers as if they were mere mist, and of battles where its necrotic energy turned the tide in favor of its wielder.

However, the Rapier of Life Stealing is also a curse. Its desire for life force can become insatiable, driving its wielder to seek combat relentlessly. It's said that the weapon whispers to its owner, urging them to strike down friends and foes alike to feed its thirst

The true extent of the rapier's abilities and its history remains shrouded in mystery, as it continues to be a coveted artifact for those who seek power over life and death. Its story is a blend of triumph and tragedy, a reminder of the price of wielding such unfathomable power.
