\section*{Appearance}
The Crystal Blade Rapier is a breathtaking weapon, its long, narrow blade fashioned from the shimmering horn of a crystal dragon. The blade is translucent, with veins of light running through it, glowing softly with a faint blue hue. When wielded in battle, it seems to pulse with life, radiating an otherworldly energy. The hilt is as elegant as the blade, crafted from polished silver and gold filigree. Intricate engravings of dragons and runic symbols wind around the guard, while small, clear gemstones sparkle along its surface, enhancing the blade’s already radiant nature.

In the presence of light, the blade reflects and refracts, casting prismatic glimmers in all directions, giving the rapier an ethereal aura. The balance of the weapon is near perfect, combining the precision of a fencer’s blade with the weight and authority of a magical artifact. The light that emanates from the sword can be controlled at will, illuminating the battlefield or cloaking the rapier in subtle, dim light for stealthy maneuvers. This weapon exudes a sense of majesty and power, befitting the essence of the crystal dragon from which it was forged.

\section*{History}
The Crystal Blade Rapier is steeped in legend, said to have been forged from the spine of a mighty crystal dragon that once roamed the highest peaks of the world. Crafted by a master swordsmith in the service of a long-forgotten kingdom, the rapier was imbued with powerful magic drawn from the essence of the dragon itself. It became a symbol of light and hope, often wielded by champions in times of great darkness. Over centuries, the weapon passed from one heroic hand to another, always finding its way to those with noble hearts and a will to protect.

The rapier's magical properties have made it highly sought after, particularly its ability to deal extra radiant damage with each strike, punishing enemies with a blinding brilliance. The blade holds three magical charges, each allowing the wielder to heal themselves by absorbing the radiant energy it inflicts on foes. The sword also carries the dragon's natural affinity for light, able to illuminate the darkness at its wielder's command, making it both a tool of battle and a beacon for allies.

\section*{Magic}
This magic rapier's blade is fashioned from a horn or spine from a crystal dragon. When you hit with an attack roll using this rapier, the target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.

The rapier has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with an attack roll using the rapier, you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the extra radiant damage the rapier dealt.

While you're holding the rapier, you can use a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, to cause it to shed dim light in a 10-foot radius, or to douse the light.
