\section*{Appearance}
Forged from a mysterious arcane alloy harvested from the depths of forgotten realms, the Acheron Blade exudes a haunting elegance. Its slender, jet-black blade gleams with a muted, metallic luster, as if it drinks in the surrounding light. Faint crimson and violet veins of arcane energy pulse just beneath the surface, like the heartbeat of some ancient, slumbering power.

The hilt is masterfully crafted with infernal artistry — a crossguard shaped like outstretched demonic wings curves protectively over the wielder's hand, forged in dark iron with crimson inlays. Ancient runes, etched in a long-lost dialect, shimmer subtly along the grip, reacting faintly to the touch of a worthy bearer. The pommel bears the image of a single downward-facing eye, crafted from obsidian and always unnervingly cold.

\section*{History}
The origins of the Acheron Blade are shrouded in myth and shadow, its true creation lost to time and planar war. It is widely believed to have been forged in the lower planes, within a forgotten forge-city that once stood on the banks of the River Acheron - the iron-choked river that flows through the realms of lawful evil. The alloy used in its crafting is not native to the Material Plane, suspected to be a fusion of infernal steel and crystallized soul matter harvested from ancient battlegrounds where devils and mortals clashed endlessly.

Legends tell of a mortal blacksmith named Varnem the Hollow, who bargained with a dying archdevil for the knowledge of soulbinding metallurgy. Varnem disappeared shortly after his pact, but not before completing a single weapon — the Acheron Blade. It was said that the sword would choose only those with the will to command death and order alike, and punish those who wielded it with unworthy purpose.

Over centuries, the blade surfaced in various conquests and calamities. It was last recorded in the hands of Knight-Inquisitor Thassir of the Obsidian Creed, who used it to lay waste to a rebellious kingdom under suspicion of demonic corruption. Thassir vanished during a planar incursion near a known Acheron rift, and the sword has remained lost — until now.

Some claim the blade whispers to its bearer. Others say it is a fragment of a greater weapon forged by Hell itself. Whatever the truth, those who possess the Acheron Blade carry more than just steel — they carry a legacy of power, order, and damnation.
