\section*{Appearance}
The Feather of Monara is a breathtaking peacock feather, its long, iridescent strands shimmering with hues of deep sapphire, emerald, and gold. The intricate "eye" at its tip glows with a soft, ethereal light, shifting colors as if holding a fragment of the dawn sky within. Encased in a delicate, golden frame adorned with arcane engravings, the feather rests within a crystalline housing, its edges encrusted with tiny gemstones that pulse with a faint, rhythmic energy. An aura of gentle warmth and serenity surrounds it, whispering of its legendary healing powers.

\section*{History}
Once a year, on the eve of the Verdant Renewal, the celestial peacock Monara, guardian of life and restoration, bestows a single, radiant feather upon the town of Ornende. This sacred gift is said to descend from the heavens in a cascade of iridescent light, appearing at the heart of the town's central shrine. The feather carries Monara's divine essence, a beacon of healing and renewal meant to aid those in need.

For centuries, the Feather of Monara has been revered as a harbinger of prosperity, used by the town's healers to mend the gravely wounded, cure the sick, and bless the land with fertility. Legends tell that the feather only retains its magic until the next Verdant Renewal, when it vanishes in a burst of golden light - returning to Monara's celestial roost until it is gifted once more. The townsfolk gather in solemn celebration each year, offering prayers of gratitude in hopes of receiving the feather again, knowing that with it comes Monara's divine favor.

\section*{Magic}
If you touch a creature with the Feather of Monara any disease that affects the creature are cured and it removes the blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and poisoned conditions. The feather then disappears.
