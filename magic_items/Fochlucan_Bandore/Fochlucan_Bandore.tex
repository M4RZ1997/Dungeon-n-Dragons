\chapter*{Fochlucan Bandore}
\itemDescriptionAndImage{Wondrous item, instrument, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)}{Fochlucan_Bandore.png}{10.25cm}\\

\textit{An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college.}

\section*{Appearance}
The "Fochlucan Bandore" is a mesmerizing musical instrument that beautifully merges the traditional forms of a bandore and a lute. It features an elegantly curved body, reminiscent of a bandore, but extends into a longer, slender neck characteristic of a lute, culminating in a distinctively crafted headstock. The instrument's surface is a canvas of intricate carvings and inlays, depicting mystical symbols and ancient runes, hinting at its magical origins. Its rich, warm wood tones are accentuated by a deep varnish, giving it an antique yet well-maintained appearance. Perhaps its most striking feature is its shimmering, light-like strings, adding a magical quality to its already ethereal aesthetic. This blend of artistic beauty, arcane significance, and ancient tradition renders the Fochlucan Bandore not just a musical instrument, but a remarkable piece of art and a mystical artifact, resonating with an aura of age-old lore and enchantment.

\section*{Arcane Challenge}
A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

\section*{Charming Harmony}
You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

\section*{Spellcasting Ability}
You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
\subsection*{Standard Spells for Bard Instruments}
All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: Fly, Invisibility, Levitate, and Protection from Evil and Good.
\subsection*{Unique Spells of the Fochlucan Bandore}
In addition, the Fochlucan Bandore can be used to cast Entangle, Faerie Fire, Shillelagh, and Speak with Animals.
