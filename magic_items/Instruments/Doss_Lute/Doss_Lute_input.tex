\chapter*{Doss Lute}
\itemDescriptionAndImage{Wondrous item, instrument, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)}{Doss_Lute.png}{6.75cm}\\

\noindent\textit{An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college.}

\section*{History}
It was said that a legendary bard in the Moonshaes named Falataer created the first Doss lute. He used the lute to both test and reward students of his bardic college. Subsequent bards copied the design but continued to keep the same name.

\section*{Arcane Challenge}
A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

\section*{Charming Harmony}
You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

\section*{Spellcasting Ability}
You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
\subsection*{Standard Spells for Bard Instruments}
All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: Fly, Invisibility, Levitate, and Protection from Evil and Good.
\subsection*{Unique Spells of the Doss Lute}
In addition, the Doss Lute can be used to cast Animal Friendship, Protection from Energy (fire only), Protection from Poison.
