\itemDescriptionAndImage{Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement by an artificer)}{All-Purpose_Tool.png}{8.25cm}
\section*{Appearance}
The All-Purpose Tool is a masterwork of arcane craftsmanship, radiating an aura of ingenuity and adaptability. Its intricate, metallic frame is engraved with swirling, runic patterns that seem to shift faintly when observed closely, as though infused with a subtle, magical energy. The tool's handle is cylindrical, finely crafted from polished metal that gleams even in dim light, and tapers to a beautifully symmetrical point.

At the core of the tool lies a softly glowing, golden filament encased within a transparent chamber, its light pulsing gently in rhythm with its wielder's intent. This luminous energy source provides both illumination and a sense of mysterious power, hinting at its versatile magical properties. The tip of the tool forms a precise, blade-like edge, but the shimmering energy surrounding it suggests it can morph to suit the user's needs, whether as a chisel, screwdriver, quill, or even a weapon.

\section*{History}
The All-Purpose Tool was first discovered by the brilliant artificer G.E. Petto in the ruins of an ancient civilization. At first glance, it seemed like nothing more than a mundane, battered screwdriver, but Petto's keen intuition revealed the latent magic within. Using its hidden potential, he created extraordinary constructs, blending magic and engineering. Though its full capabilities eluded him, Petto understood the artifact was no ordinary tool - it was a relic of boundless possibility.

When Petto completed A.R.T.I.F.I.C.E.R-$\beta$, a sentient automaton, he saw in $\beta$ a being of promise. However, pressure from patrons to replace $\beta$ with newer models forced Petto to make a difficult decision. On the eve of $\beta$'s departure, Petto gifted the screwdriver to him, saying, \textit{"It's not just a tool - it's a guide, a challenge, and a mystery. And so are you."} With those words, $\beta$ set off into the world.

During his travels, $\beta$ began to uncover the screwdriver's true nature. Through experimentation, he unlocked its potential: the All-Purpose Tool could transform into any implement he imagined and even amplify his magical abilities. It became an extension of his ingenuity, a symbol of his creator's faith, and a key to his own evolution. To the world, it is a legendary artifact of unmatched versatility. To $\beta$, it remains a reminder of his journey and limitless potential.

\section*{Magic}
This simple screwdriver can transform into a variety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of artisan's tool of your choice (see the "Equipment" chapter in the Player's Handbook for a list of artisan's tools). Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it. While holding this tool, you gain a +2 bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells.

As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
