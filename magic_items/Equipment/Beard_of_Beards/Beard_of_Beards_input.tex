\section*{History}

\section*{Magic}
While being attuned to the \textsc{Beard of Beards} its wearer gains the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Your Charisma score is increased by 2, to a maximum of 20
	\item The beard can change its appearance giving you proficiency in the Deception skill
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Animation Effect}
Once every long rest you can choose up to two nonmagical objects within 120 ft. range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as two objects. You can't animate any object larger than Medium. Each target animates and becomes a bearded creature under your control for 1 minute or until reduced to 0 hit points.
	
As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
	
\subsubsection*{Animated Object Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tiny - HP: 20, AC: 18, Attack: +8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage, Str: 4, Dex: 18
	\item Small - HP: 25, AC: 16, Attack: +6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage, Str: 6, Dex: 14
	\item Medium - HP: 40, AC: 13, Attack: +5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage, Str: 10, Dex: 12
\end{itemize}
	
An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determine by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet, if the objects lack legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.

If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determine by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

\subsection*{Defensive Beard}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Your AC is increased by 1
	\item You can target a friendly creature within 60 ft. of you. It grows its own beard if it has none, or its beard becomes visible thicker if it already has one. The creature's AC is increased by 1 and its Charisma score is increased by 1, to a maximum of 20. The effect ends after 10 minutes. This effect can be used twice per long rest and only once at a time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{VÃ¶llig bekloppte Idee}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You can target any creature within 60 ft. of you without a long beard. It grows its own beard which increases the creature's AC by 1 and its Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20. However, the creature is not able to speak as long as it has grown a beard. The effect ends after 1 minute. This effect can be used thrice per long rest and only once at a time.
