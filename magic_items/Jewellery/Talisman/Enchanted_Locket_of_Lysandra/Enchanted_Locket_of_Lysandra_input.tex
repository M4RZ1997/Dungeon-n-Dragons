\chapter*{The Enchanted Locket of Lysandra}
\itemDescriptionAndImage{Locket, rare (requires attunement)}{Locket_of_Lysandra.png}{10cm}

\section*{Appearance}
The Enchanted Locket of Lysandra appears as a simple and unadorned silver locket on a delicate chain. To the casual observer, it looks like an ordinary piece of jewelry with no special significance. However, upon closer inspection, however, the true magic of the locket becomes apparent. Faint, ever-shifting patterns of light dance across its surface like playful fireflies on a warm summer night. These ethereal luminescent swirls seem to weave intricate stories, their fleeting forms conjuring images of blooming wildflowers, starlit skies, and the elusive spirits of the Feywild. Each flicker of light holds a hint of forgotten tales, a connection to a realm of dreams that exists just beyond the veil of perception.

Adding to the intrigue, the locket possesses a set of minuscule, intricately wrought hinges that are barely discernible to the naked eye. These hinges, delicate as the gossamer wings of a butterfly, are an enigma in themselves, for they hint at the locket's potential to open and reveal its secrets. Yet, despite their apparent purpose, there is no physical means or any clue to unlocking the locket's hidden interior. It remains a tantalizing riddle, waiting for the touch of someone who holds both the key and the knowledge to unlock its mysteries.

\section*{History}
Legends speak of Lysandra, a powerful and enigmatic fey enchantress who once roamed the realms of Prismeer. Known for her boundless curiosity and mischievous nature, Lysandra was said to possess an item of unimaginable enchantment, capable of granting its bearer unparalleled insight into the secrets of the Feywild. The Enchanted Locket is believed to be a fragment of her lost legacy.

\section*{Magic}
The locket has several magical properties, though Alistair might not be aware of all its abilities at the start of the campaign. As he uncover mores about the relic, he will discover its true potential. Some of its known abilities include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Fey Sensitivity:} The locket resonates with the energy of the Feywild, allowing its bearer to sense the presence of fey creatures and magical phenomena nearby. However, at times the holder becomes increasingly fixated on uncovering its secrets, neglecting other aspects of their life and their original quest. They might struggle to focus on anything else, including the well-being of their companions.
	\item \textbf{Dreams of the Fey:} When worn during sleep, the locket can grant visions and cryptic dreams about the Feywild, which become more unsettling as the influence of the locket grows.
	\item \textbf{Portal Attunement:} The locket can attune its bearer to specific Feywild locations, potentially serving as a key to unlock hidden pathways between the material world and the Feywild. But this bond could attract the attention of malevolent fey entities. These entities might attempt to manipulate or coerce your character into serving their own mysterious agendas.
	\item \textbf{Whisper of Lysandra:} In moments of uncertainty or danger, the locket may emit soft whispers of ancient Feywild wisdom, guiding its bearer's decisions - either helpful or malicious.
	\item \textbf{Mistrust of Mortals:} The locket's connection to the Feywild might foster a growing sense of alienation from the mortal world. The holder becomes more distant from non-fey creatures, finding it difficult to trust them.
	\item \textbf{Fading Identity:} As your character delves deeper into the locket's mysteries, they might find aspects of their identity beginning to blur. Memories of their life before the locket's influence become hazy, leading to a sense of disconnection from their past.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Compulsion}
The Enchanted Locket has a subtle yet powerful compulsion on its bearer. As your character carries the locket, its magic gradually influences their emotions and desires, kindling an insatiable fascination with the Feywild. The more they interact with the Feywild or embark on quests related to Prismeer, the stronger this compulsion becomes.

The locket's influence amplifies its bearer's natural magical inclinations, deepening his understanding of arcane secrets and Feywild lore. This newfound magical prowess enhances the Charismatic abilities of its bearer:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\ast$] \textbf{Level 4-6:} You gain a +1 bonus to Charisma ability checks while being attuned to the locket.
	\item \textbf{Level 7-11:} You gain a +2 bonus to Charisma ability checks and a -1 malus to Wisdom ability checks while being attuned to the locket.
	\item \textbf{Level 11-16:} You gain a +3 bonus to Charisma ability checks and a -1 malus to Wisdom ability checks while being attuned to the locket.
	\item \textbf{Level 17+:} You gain a +4 bonus to Charisma ability checks and a -2 malus to Wisdom ability checks while being attuned to the locket.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Curse of Whispered Entanglement}
The Enchanted Locket of Lysandra, despite its allure, carries a hidden curse that intertwines the bearer's fate with the whims of the Feywild. While the locket's charisma-enhancing effects are a boon, the Curse of Whispered Entanglement gradually begins to exert its influence, whispering subtle manipulations into the bearer's mind.

\paragraph*{Curse}
Once the character is attuned to this locket, he can not willingly unattune off it unless he is targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic.

\paragraph{Compelled Decision}
Whenever a decision must be made or information is sought, the locket's magic compels the bearer to heed its suggestions. The Dungeon Master decides what the locket suggests in each situation. The bearer must succeed a Charisma Saving Throw for any decision the locket suggests or a Wisdom Saving Throw for any information the locket reveals. If the saving throw fails, the bearer is fully convinced by the locket's suggestion and feels compelled to act on it. If the saving throw is successful, the bearer can resist the locket's influence and make their own decision. The DC is increasing by the following means:
\eject
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Save DC starts at a value of 10
	\item With every successful Saving Throw regarding this effect the bearer makes the Save DC increases by 0.5
	\item With every failed Saving Throw regarding this effect the bearer makes the Save DC increases by 0.2
\end{itemize}
\section*{Torn between Worlds}
While the locket provides Alistair with extraordinary insights and magical abilities, its influence comes at a cost. The more time he spends away from the Feywild or the locket, the more he feels an ache of longing and a sense of restlessness. Their connection with the locket intertwines his fate with that of the Feywild, making him feel incomplete whenever he is separated from it.
\section*{Quest of Discovery}
The Enigmatic Locket of Lysandra possesses an inherent, magical allure that captivates the heart and mind of Alistair, the Bard. When he first encountered the locket, he was drawn to it by an irresistible pull, not fully comprehending why it called to him so strongly. From that moment on, he found himself becoming increasingly obsessed with uncovering the locket's true nature and its connection to the Feywild.
