\section*{SpecOp Penguin Traits}
\subsection*{Arctic Native}
You have resistance to cold damage. You are immune to the to the effects of both cold weather and Extreme Cold as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide (page 110). Furthermore, you do not treat shallow water, snow, or ice as difficult terrain.
\subsection*{Creature of the Sea}
You can breathe air and water, and you have resistance to cold damage. Aquatic animals have an extraordinary affinity with your people. You can communicate simple ideas to any Beast that has a swimming speed. It can understand your words, though you have no special ability to understand it in return.
\subsection*{Penguin Nimbleness}
You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Your base walking speed is 20 feet but you can use your bonus action to "belly slide"; increasing your walking speed by 20 feet. While "belly sliding" you cannot use the Attack Action and also cannot cast spells or use objects. As an action you can stop belly sliding and stand up. You also have a swim speed of 50 feet.
\subsection*{Penguin Strike}
If you have advantage on the attack roll and you are hidden from the target, you can make an unarmed strike stunning the target until the end of its next turn. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your attack roll DC (the DC can be set at 10 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, depending on your character build) or is stunned for 1 addtional round. If the target's hit points are equal to or lower than half of their maximum hit points and they fail the save, they are knocked unconscious for 1 minute or until they take damage. You can use this attack equal to half your player level rounded down per long rest.
