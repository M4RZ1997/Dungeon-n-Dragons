\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{SpecOp Penguin Traits}
\subsection*{Arctic Native}
You have resistance to cold damage. You are immune to the to the effects of both cold weather and Extreme Cold as described in the Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide (page 110). Furthermore, you do not treat shallow water, snow, or ice as difficult terrain.
\subsection*{Creature of the Sea}
You can breathe air and water, and you have resistance to cold damage. Aquatic animals have an extraordinary affinity with your people. You can communicate simple ideas to any Beast that has a swimming speed. It can understand your words, though you have no special ability to understand it in return.
\subsection*{Penguin Nimbleness}
You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Your base walking speed is 20 feet but you can use your bonus action to "belly slide"; increasing your walking speed by 20 feet. While "belly sliding" you cannot use the Attack Action and also cannot cast spells or use objects. As an action you can stop belly sliding and stand up. You also have a swim speed of 50 feet.
\subsection*{Penguin Strike}
If you have advantage on the attack roll and you are hidden from the target, you can make an unarmed strike stunning the target until the end of its next turn. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your attack roll DC (the DC can be set at 10 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, depending on your character build) or is stunned for 1 addtional round. If the target's hit points are equal to or lower than half of their maximum hit points and they fail the save, they are knocked unconscious for 1 minute or until they take damage. You can use this attack equal to half your player level rounded down per long rest.

\section*{Soldier}
War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to prominence during a recent war.

When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine which military organization you were a part of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what kind of experiences you had during your military career. Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia? Or it might have been a noble's or merchant's private army, or a mercenary company.
\subsection*{Military Rank}
\textbf{Officer}\\
You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.

\section*{Fighter Traits}
\subsection*{Fighting Style}
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
\subsubsection*{Blind Fighting}
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

\subsection*{Second Wind}
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
\subsection*{Action Surge}
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
\subsection*{Martial Archetype (Battle Master)}
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.
\paragraph*{Maneuvers} You learn three maneuvers of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.
\paragraph*{Superiority Dice (4 d8)} You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest. You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.

\paragraph*{Saving Throws} Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

\textbf{Maneuver Save DC} = \intcalcAdd{8}{\intcalcAdd{\ProficiencyValue}{\calculateModifier{\StrengthScoreValue}}}
\subsubsection*{Student of War}
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.
\subsubsection*{Known Maneuvers}
\paragraph*{Ambush}
When you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or an initiative roll, you can expend one superiority die and add the die to the roll, provided you aren't incapacitated.
\paragraph*{Menacing Attack}
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
\paragraph*{Riposte}
When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.
