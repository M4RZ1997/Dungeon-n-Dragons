\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{SpecOp Penguin Traits}
\subsection*{Arctic Native}
You have resistance to cold damage. You are immune to the to the effects of both cold weather and Extreme Cold as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide (page 110). Furthermore, you do not treat shallow water, snow, or ice as difficult terrain.
\subsection*{Creature of the Sea}
You can breathe air and water, and you have resistance to cold damage. Aquatic animals have an extraordinary affinity with your people. You can communicate simple ideas to any Beast that has a swimming speed. It can understand your words, though you have no special ability to understand it in return.
\subsection*{Penguin Nimbleness}
You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Your base walking speed is 20 feet but you can use your bonus action to "belly slide"; increasing your walking speed by 20 feet. While "belly sliding" you cannot use the Attack Action and also cannot cast spells or use objects. As an action you can stop belly sliding and stand up. You also have a swim speed of 50 feet.
\subsection*{Penguin Strike}
If you have advantage on the attack roll and you are hidden from the target, you can make an unarmed strike stunning the target until the end of its next turn. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your attack roll DC (the DC can be set at 10 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, depending on your character build) or is stunned for 1 addtional round. If the target's hit points are equal to or lower than half of their maximum hit points and they fail the save, they are knocked unconscious for 1 minute or until they take damage. You can use this attack equal to half your player level rounded down per short rest.

\section*{Swallowed Bag of Holding}
\textit{Rico's stomach functions akin to a Bag of Holding. However, his impulsive act of consumption has resulted in a slight distortion of the Bag's enchantment, introducing an element of unpredictability.}
\subsection*{Ability}
\paragraph*{Stomach Storage}\hfill\\
Rico can consume and store items within his stomach, emulating the properties of a Bag of Holding. Through a mysterious process, items vanish into the depths of his digestive system, remaining safe until called upon.
\paragraph*{Retrieval Mastery}\hfill\\
With practiced control, Rico can summon forth stored items at will. By focusing his concentration, he draws the desired object from the recesses of his Bag-like stomach, ready for use in his adventures.
\subsection*{\textsc{Flaw}: Random Item Retrieval}
\textit{However, Rico's impromptu acquisition of the Bag of Holding through consumption has not come without consequences. The arcane energies within his stomach occasionally manifest unpredictably, leading to a phenomenon known as random item retrieval.}
\paragraph*{Probability Shift}\hfill\\

As the quantity of items stored within Rico's stomach increases, so too does the likelihood of retrieving an unintended item. The slight damage to the Bag's enchantment has rendered it prone to whims of chance, complicating Rico's reliance on its contents.
\paragraph*{Probability Thresholds}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Whenever you attempt to retrieve an item from his stomach, roll a d20
	\item The threshold for a successful retrieval of the desired item increases as the number of stored items grows.
	\item The initial threshold is a DC5
	\item For each item above the 10th this DC increses by 0.5
	\item The random item appearing is at the DMs discretion
\end{itemize}

\section*{Primitive Tribe}
You come from a primitive tribe that has had no interaction with 'modern' civilization. Nearly everything is new to you. Things that everyone else takes for granted are fascinating to you at least at first. You ask dumb questions though sometimes these questions are actually very smart because you ask about things that no one else questions. You generally do things the wrong way (for example putting on armor) until someone shows you how to do them. However you are also attuned to things of nature that other people don't notice.
\subsection*{Tension Sense}
You are attuned to the sounds of the creatures in the natural environment around you. You can tell when there is danger, or something unnatural going on, because you can sense the tension in the environment around you.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tension sense does not work in a city, castle, town, dungeon, or open ocean (but it does work in a village or isolated tower).
\end{itemize}

\section*{Barbarian Traits}
\subsection*{Rage}
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

\begin{itemize}
	\item You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
	\item When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
	\item You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
\end{itemize}
If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.
\subsection*{Unarmored Defense}
While you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
\subsection*{Reckless Attack}
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
\subsection*{Danger Sense}
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
\subsection*{Primal Path (Wild Magic)}
Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic. These magic-suffused barbarians walk the Path of Wild Magic. Elf, tiefling, aasimar, and genasi barbarians often seek this path, eager to manifest the otherworldly magic of their ancestors.
\subsubsection*{Magic Awareness}
When you choose this path at 3rd level, as an action, you can open your awareness to the presence of concentrated magic. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any spell or magic item within 60 feet of you that isn’t behind total cover. When you sense a spell, you learn which school of magic it belongs to.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
\subsubsection*{Wild Surge}
Also at 3rd level, the magical energy roiling inside you sometimes erupts from you. When you enter your rage, roll on the Wild Magic table to determine the magical effect produced.

If the effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Wild Magic]{lX}
\textbf{d8} &\textbf{Effect}\\
1			& each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 necrotic damage. You also gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 plus your barbarian level.\\
2			& You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action.\\
3			& An intangible spirit, which looks like a flumph or a pixie (your choice), appears within 5 feet of one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. At the end of the current turn, the spirit explodes, and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again, summoning another spirit, on each of your turns as a bonus action.\\
4			& Magic infuses one weapon of your choice that you are holding. Until your rage ends, the weapon's damage type changes to force, and it gains the light and thrown properties, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the weapon leaves your hand, the weapon reappears in your hand at the end of the current turn.\\
5			& Whenever a creature hits you with an attack roll before your rage ends, that creature takes 1d6 force damage, as magic lashes out in retribution.	\\
6			& Until your rage ends, you are surrounded by multicolored, protective lights; you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and while within 10 feet of you, your allies gain the same bonus.	\\
7			& Flowers and vines temporarily grow around you; until your rage ends, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies.	\\
8			& A bolt of light shoots from your chest. Another creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage and be blinded until the start of your next turn. Until your rage ends, you can use this effect again on each of your turns as a bonus action.	\\
