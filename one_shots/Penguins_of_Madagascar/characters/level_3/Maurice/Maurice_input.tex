\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{Lemur of Madagascar Traits}
\subsection*{Like to MOVE IT!}
You gain proficiency in the Performance and Acrobatics skills. If you already have proficiency in those skills or gain these proficiency, you will gain expertise in those skills instead. You also gain advantage for Performance Skill rolls if performing in a group of size 3 or larger.
\subsection*{Stealth Sense}
When well-rested, you are able to sense that someone or something is in stealth but you are unable to pinpoint its' location if you are within 50 feet of it.
\subsection*{Arboreal Movement}
You have a climbing speed of 35 feet and roll with advantage on climbing/jumping tasks.

\section*{Druid Traits}
Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature, but see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.
\subsection*{Wild Shape}
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Beast Shapes]{llXl}
\textbf{Level}	& \textbf{Max. CR}  	&\textbf{Limitations}			&\textbf{Example}	\\
2nd 			& 1/4					&No flying or swimming speed	&Wolf				\\
4th 			& 1/2					&No flying speed				&Crocodile			\\
8th 			& 1						&								&Giant Eagle		\\
\end{DndTable}
You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
	\item When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form, For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
	\item You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast.
	\item You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
	\item You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Druid Circle}
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
\subsection*{Druid of Spores}
Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. They see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.
\subsubsection*{Circle Spells}
Your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the Chill Touch cantrip.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Circle of Spores Spells]{llX}
			& \textbf{Druid Level}  	&\textbf{Circle Spells}				\\
$\bullet$	& 2nd						&Chill Touch						\\
$\bullet$	& 3rd						&Blindness/Deafness, Gentle Repose	\\
			& 5th						&Animate Dead, Gaseous Form			\\
			& 7th						&Blight, Confusion					\\
			& 9th						&Cloudkill, Contagion				\\
\end{DndTable}
\subsubsection*{Halo of Spores}
Starting at 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.
\subsubsection*{Symbiotic Entity}
Also at 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
	\item Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.
\end{itemize}
These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points or until you use your Wild Shape again.

\section*{Spells}
\subsection*{Cantrip}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Chill Touch}
  {Necromancy Cantrip}
  {1 Action}
  {120 foot}
  {V, S}
  {1 Round}

You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

\DndSpellHeader
  {Guidance}
  {Divination Cantrip}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S}
  {Concentration, up to 1 Minute}

You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Shape Water}
  {Transmutation Cantrip}
  {1 Action}
  {30 feet}
  {S}
  {Instantaneous or 1 Hour}

You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
	\item You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.
	\item You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.
	\item You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.
	\item You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.
\end{itemize}
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

\subsection*{Level 1}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Absorb Elements}
  {1st-Level Abjuration}
  {1 Reaction, which you take when you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage}
  {Self}
  {S}
  {1 Round}

The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type, and the spell ends.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Detect Magic}
  {1st-Level Divination (Ritual)}
  {1 Action}
  {Self}
  {V, S}
  {Concentration, up to 10 Minutes}

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Entangle}
  {1st-Level Conjuration}
  {1 Action}
  {90 feet}
  {V, S}
  {Concentration, up to 1 Minute}

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Fairie Fire}
  {1st-Level Evocation}
  {1 Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V}
  {Concentration, up to 1 Minute}

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice).

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Healing Word}
  {1st-Level Evocation}
  {1 Bonus Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V}
  {Instantaneous}

A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

\subsection*{Level 2}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Blindness/Deafness}
  {2nd-Level Necromancy}
  {1 Action}
  {30 feet}
  {V}
  {1 Minute}

You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Gentle Repose}
  {2nd-Level Necromancy (Ritual)}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)}
  {10 Days}

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead.

The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Augury}
  {2nd-Level Divination (Ritual)}
  {1 Minute}
  {Self}
  {V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)}
  {Instantaneous}

By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Weal, for good results
	\item Woe, for bad results
	\item Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
	\item Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad
\end{itemize}
The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Continual Flame}
  {2nd-Level Evocation}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)}
  {Until dispelled}

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Darkvision}
  {2nd-Level Transmutation}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)}
  {8 Hours}

You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Enhance Ability}
  {2nd-Level Transmutation}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (fur or a feather from a beast)}
  {Concentration, up to 1 Hour}

You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains the effect until the spell ends.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Bear’s Endurance.} The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell ends.
	\item \textbf{Bull’s Strength.} The target has advantage on Strength checks, and their carrying capacity doubles.
	\item \textbf{Cat’s Grace.} The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t incapacitated.
	\item \textbf{Eagle’s Splendor.} The target has advantage on Charisma checks.
	\item \textbf{Fox’s Cunning.} The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.
	\item \textbf{Owl’s Wisdom.} The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Lesser Restoration}
  {2nd-Level Abjuration}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

You touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Pass Without Trace}
  {2nd-Level Abjuration}
  {1 Action}
  {Self}
  {V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)}
  {Concentration, up to 1 Hour}

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Spike Growth}
  {2nd-Level Transmutation}
  {1 Action}
  {150 feet}
  {V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)}
  {Concentration, up to 10 Minutes}

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Summon Beast}
  {2nd-Level Conjuration}
  {1 Action}
  {90 feet}
  {V, S, M (a feather, tuft of fur, and fish tail inside a gilded acorn worth at least 200 gp)}
  {Concentration, up to 1 Hour}

You call forth a bestial spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Bestial Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an environment: Air, Land, or Water. The creature resembles an animal of your choice that is native to the chosen environment, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, use the higher level where the spell’s level appears in the stat block.
