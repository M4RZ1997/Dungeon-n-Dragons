\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{SpecOp Penguin Traits}
\subsection*{Arctic Native}
You have resistance to cold damage. You are immune to the to the effects of both cold weather and Extreme Cold as described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide (page 110). Furthermore, you do not treat shallow water, snow, or ice as difficult terrain.
\subsection*{Creature of the Sea}
You can breathe air and water, and you have resistance to cold damage. Aquatic animals have an extraordinary affinity with your people. You can communicate simple ideas to any Beast that has a swimming speed. It can understand your words, though you have no special ability to understand it in return.
\subsection*{Penguin Nimbleness}
You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. Your base walking speed is 20 feet but you can use your bonus action to "belly slide"; increasing your walking speed by 20 feet. While "belly sliding" you cannot use the Attack Action and also cannot cast spells or use objects. As an action you can stop belly sliding and stand up. You also have a swim speed of 50 feet.
\subsection*{Penguin Strike}
If you have advantage on the attack roll and you are hidden from the target, you can make an unarmed strike stunning the target until the end of its next turn. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your attack roll DC (the DC can be set at 10 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, depending on your character build) or is stunned for 1 addtional round. If the target's hit points are equal to or lower than half of their maximum hit points and they fail the save, they are knocked unconscious for 1 minute or until they take damage. You can use this attack equal to half your player level rounded down per long rest.

\section*{Courtier}
In your earlier days, you were a personage of some significance in a noble court or a bureaucratic organization. You might or might not come from an upper-class family; your talents, rather than the circumstances of your birth, could have secured you this position.

You might have been one of the many functionaries, attendants, and other hangers-on in the Court of Silverymoon, or perhaps you traveled in Waterdeep's baroque and sometimes cutthroat conglomeration of guilds, nobles, adventurers, and secret societies. You might have been one of the behind-the-scenes law-keepers or functionaries in Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter, or you might have grown up in and around the castle of Daggerford.

Even if you are no longer a full-fledged member of the group that gave you your start in life, your relationships with your former fellows can be an advantage for you and your adventuring comrades. You might undertake missions with your new companions that further the interest of the organization that gave you your start in life. In any event, the abilities that you honed while serving as a courtier will stand you in good stead as an adventurer.
\subsection*{Court Functionary}
Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are.

\section*{Crossbow Expert}
Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.
	\item Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
	\item When you use the Attack action and attack with a one handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a hand crossbow you are holding.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Spell Sniper}
You have learned techniques to enhance your attacks with certain kinds of spells, gaining the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the spell's range is doubled.
	\item Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
	\item You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll. Choose the cantrip from the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip depends on the spell list you chose from: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, and warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Warlock Traits}
\subsection*{Otherwordly Patron (The Hexblade)}
\subsubsection*{Expanded Spell List}
The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Law Domain Spells]{lX}
\textbf{Spell Level}  	&\textbf{Spells}						\\
1st						&Shield, Wrathful Smite					\\
2nd						&Blur, Branding Smite					\\
3rd						&Blink, Elemental Weapon				\\
4th						&Phantasmal Killer, Staggering Smite	\\
5th						&Banishing Smite, Cone of Cold			\\
\end{DndTable}
\subsubsection*{Hexblade's Curse}
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
	\item Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
	\item If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).
\end{itemize}
You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
\subsubsection*{Hex Warrior}
At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.
\subsubsection*{Accursed Specter}
Starting at 6th level, you can curse the soul of a person you slay, temporarily binding it in your service. When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).

The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.

Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.
\subsection*{Eldritch Invocations}
In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.
\subsubsection*{Known Invocations}
\paragraph*{Agonizing Blast}\hfill\\
When you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.\\
\paragraph*{Eldritch Mind}\hfill\\
You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell.\\
\paragraph*{Ghostly Gaze}\hfill\\
As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have darkvision if you don't already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.

Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\\
\paragraph*{Investment of the Chain Master}\hfill\\
When you cast find familiar, you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The familiar gains either a flying speed or a \textbf{swimming speed} (your choice) of 40 feet.
	\item As a bonus action, you can command the familiar to take the Attack action.
	\item The familiar's weapon attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.
	\item If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.
	\item When the familiar takes damage, you can use your reaction to grant it resistance against that damage.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Pact Boon (Pact of the Chain)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.
	\item When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.
	\item Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Spells}

	{Evocation cantrip}
	{1 Action}
	{120 feet}
	{V, S}
	{Instantaneous}

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

\DndSpellHeader
	{Mage Hand}
	{Conjuration cantrip}
	{1 Action}
	{30 feet}
	{V, S}
	{1 Minute}

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

\DndSpellHeader
	{Mind Sliver}
	{Enchantment cantrip}
	{1 Action}
	{60 feet}
	{V}
	{1 Round}

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

\DndSpellHeader
	{Prestidigation}
	{Transmutation cantrip}
	{1 Action}
	{10 feet}
	{V, S}
	{Up to 1 hour}

This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

\begin{itemize}
	\item You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
	\item You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
	\item You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
	\item You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
	\item You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
	\item You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.
\end{itemize}
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

\subsection*{Level 1}

\DndSpellHeader
	{Armor of Agathy}
	{1st-Level Abjuration}
	{1 Action}
	{Self}
	{V, S, M (a cup of water)}
	{1 hour}

A protective magical force surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 cold damage.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the cold damage increase by 5 for each slot.

\DndSpellHeader
	{Hex}
	{1st-Level Enchantment}
	{1 Bonus Action}
	{90 feet}
	{V, S, M (the petrified eye of a newt)}
	{Concentration, up to 1 hour}

You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. The target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to curse a new creature.

A Remove Curse cast on the target ends this spell early.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.

\subsection*{Level 2}

\DndSpellHeader
	{Invisibility}
	{2nd-Level Illusion}
	{1 Action}
	{Touch}
	{V, S, M (an eylash encased in gum arabic)}
	{Concentration, up to 1 hour}

A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

\subsection*{Level 3}

\DndSpellHeader
	{Counterspell}
	{3rd-Level Abjuration}
	{1 Reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell}
	{60 feet}
	{S}
	{Instantaneous}

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.

\DndSpellHeader
	{Dispel Magic}
	{3rd-Level Abjuration}
	{1 Action}
	{120 feet}
	{V, S}
	{Instantaneous}

Choose any creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell ends.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

\DndSpellHeader
	{Fly}
	{3rd-Level Transmutation}
	{1 Action}
	{Touch}
	{V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)}
	{Concentration, up to 10 minutes}

You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

\subsection*{Level 4}

\DndSpellHeader
	{Shadow of Moil}
	{4th-Level Necromancy}
	{1 Action}
	{Self}
	{V, S, M (an undead eyeball encased in a gem worth at least 150gp)}
	{Concentration, up to 1 minute}

Flame-like shadows wreathe your body until the spell ends, causing you to become heavily obscured to others. The shadows turn dim light within 10 feet of you into darkness, and bright light in the same area to dim light.

Until the spell ends, you have resistance to radiant damage. In addition, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, the shadows lash out at that creature, dealing it 2d8 necrotic damage.

\DndSpellHeader
	{Sickening Radiance}
	{4th-Level Evocation}
	{1 Action}
	{120 feet}
	{V, S}
	{Concentration, up to 10 minutes}

Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d10 radiant damage, and it suffers one level of exhaustion and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being invisible. The light and any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.
