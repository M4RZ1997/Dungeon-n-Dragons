\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{Aasimar Traits}
\subsection*{Darkvision}
Blessed with a radiant soul, your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
\subsection*{Celestial Resistance}
You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.
\subsection*{Healing Hands}
As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
\subsection*{Light Bearer}
You know the Light cantrip.
\subsection*{Celestial Revelation}
When you reach 3rd level, choose one of the revelation options below. Thereafter, you can use a bonus action to unleash the celestial energy within yourself, gaining the benefits of that revelation. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. Once you transform using your revelation below, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest:
\subsubsection*{Radiant Soul}
Two luminous, spectral wings sprout from your back temporarily. Until the transformation ends, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.

\section*{Judge's Apprentice}
\subsection*{Legal Acumen}
As a Judge's Apprentice, you have spent significant time learning the intricacies of cosmic law and the legal systems of various planes. You gain a +2 bonus to all Intelligence (Investigation) checks related to legal matters, understanding contracts, and interpreting local laws and customs. In addition, your insight into the human condition and motivations grants you a +2 bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks when dealing with individuals entangled in legal disputes.

\section*{Cleric}
\subsection*{Divine Domain (Law)}
As a cleric of law you are charged with upholding your god's divine mandates. Whether its bringing in suspects for questioning or passing judgement right there on the streets, the Law domain cleric seeks out violators of divine justice and seeks to punish them. You are bound by this same code and must adhere to it. You know the will of your god and their laws and concepts of justice. As such many Law domain Clerics are hired by local governments to act as law enforcement or even bounty hunters.
\subsubsection*{Expanded Spell List}
\begin{DndTable}[header=Law Domain Spells]{llX}
			& \textbf{Cleric Level}  	&\textbf{Spells}						\\
$\bullet$	& 1st						&Command, Protection from Evil and Good	\\
			& 3rd						&Arcane Lock, Zone of Truth				\\
			& 5th						&Beacon of Hope, Counterspell			\\
			& 7th						&Banishment, Private Sanctum			\\
			& 9th						&Dominate Person, Geas					\\
\end{DndTable}
\subsubsection*{A Lawful Friend}
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the Friends cantrip if you don't already know it. You also gain proficiency in the History and Persuasion skills, and one additional language of your choice.
\subsubsection*{Channel Divinity: Bringer of Law}
Starting at 2nd level you can use your Channel Divinity to cast one of the spells from the expanded spell list of this subclass that you have access to based on your level. Casting one of these spells using Bringer of Law does not consume a spell slot, but is done at their base spell level only. Spells cast using Bringer of Law cannot be dispelled with counterspell or dispel magic, but are still subject to effects that prevent the use of magic, such as antimagic field.

\subsection*{Channel Divinity}
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rest, and beginning at 18th level, you can it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
\subsubsection*{Channel Divinity: Turn Undead}
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

\section*{Spells}
\subsection*{Cantrips}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Light}
  {Evocation Cantrip}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moos)}
  {1 hour}

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.\\
If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Sacred Flame}
  {Evocation Cantrip}
  {1 Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V,S}
  {Instantaneous}
  
Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.
  
\DndSpellHeader
  {Guidance}
  {Divination Cantrip}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S}
  {Concentration, Up to 1 minute}
  
You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The spell then ends.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Mending}
  {Transmutation Cantrip}
  {1 Minute}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (2 Lodestones)}
  {Instantaneous}
  
This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.\\
This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Friends}
  {Cantrip Enchantment}
  {1 Action}
  {Self}
  {S, M (a small amount of make-up applied to the face as this spell is cast)}
  {Concentration, Up to 1 minute}
  
For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at one creature of your choice that isn't hostile toward you. When the spell ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DM's discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.

\subsection*{Level 1}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Bless}
  {1st Level Enchantment}
  {1 Action}
  {30 feet}
  {V, S, M (A sprinkling of holy water)}
  {Concentration, Up to 1 minute}
  
You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Cure Wounds}
  {1st Level Evocation}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}
  
A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the Healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Guiding Bolt}
  {1st Level Evocation}
  {1 Action}
  {120 feet}
  {V, S}
  {1 Round}
  
A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Shield of Faith}
  {1st Level Abjuration}
  {1 Bonus Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V, S, M (A small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it)}
  {Concentration, Up to 10 minutes}
  
A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Command}
  {1st Level Enchantment}
  {1 Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V}
  {1 Round}
  
You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the spell ends. Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you. Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn. Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means. Grovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn. Halt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Protection from Evil and Good}
  {1st Level Abjuration}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (Holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)}
  {Concentration, Up to 10 minutes}
  
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.\\
The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
