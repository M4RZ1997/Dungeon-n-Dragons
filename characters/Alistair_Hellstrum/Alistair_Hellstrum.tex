	Alistair Hellstrum's journey began in a bustling port city, where he was born to a humble family. From a young age, Alistair showed a natural inclination towards music and performance. He would often spend his days enchanting passersby with his melodious voice and captivating tunes, earning him a few copper coins to help support his family.
	
	However, life in the city was not without its challenges. Alistair's Tiefling heritage made him a target of prejudice and mistrust from some of the city's residents.

However, upon closer inspection, faint, ever-shifting patterns of light dance across its surface, hinting at its magical nature.\\
	Unbeknownst to Alistair it kindles an insatiable fascination with the Fewild, which becomes stronger the more he interacts with the Feywild and its creatures.
}
\AlliesAndOrganizations{
	Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.

	Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses the bards' reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, these bards rarely\linebreak
}{
	reveal their true nature unless they must. They typically claim to follow some other college, or keep their true nature secret in order to better infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.

\chapter*{Recent Backstory}

{\noindent \entryfont \DndDropCapLine{A}listair, a talented and curious Tiefling bard, led a life of modest contentment. He wandered through towns and villages, sharing his songs and stories with eager audiences, unaware of the mystical wonders that lay beyond the realm of his knowledge. Little did he know that his fate was about to take an enchanting turn. He had performed for kings and peasants alike, honing his bardic talents and captivating audiences with stories of far-off lands.

One fateful day, while traversing a dense forest, Alistair's path led him to a secluded glade untouched by time. There, nestled amidst a bed of vibrant wildflowers, lay a silver locket, emitting a faint, otherworldly glow. Intrigued, he picked it up, feeling an immediate connection - a pulse of magic that resonated deep within his being. Alistair was slowly but steadily overcome by a rush of inexplicable emotions, as if the locket had awakened a part of him he never knew existed.

As the locket's magic flowed through him, Alistair's perception of the world began to shift. Vivid dreams of the Feywild's ethereal landscapes filled his nights, drawing him into a realm of enchantment and whimsy. The locket's melodies echoed in his mind, its whispers of the Feywild's beauty and mystery becoming a siren's call that he could not ignore.\\

\paragraph*{A Peculiar Encounter} During his newfound journey of discovery, Alistair's path crossed with that of a peculiar cleric named Alaric Kain. Known not only for his devotion to his deity but also for his insatiable cleptomania, Alaric was a charismatic individual with a penchant for getting into and especially out of trouble.

Their meeting was far from cordial. One serene afternoon, Alistair discovered Alaric attempting to pilfer a trinket from his belongings. Swift as a breeze, Alistair caught the cleric in the act, their gazes locking in a tense standoff. The air crackled with tension as Alistair demanded an explanation for the attempted theft. Alaric, undeterred, smirked and admitted his intent, claiming that he had sensed the locket's magical energy and was driven to understand its potential.

Despite the initial confrontation, Alistair's curiosity led him to strike an unlikely alliance with Alaric. Recognizing that they both harbored a burning desire to reach the Feywild, they decided to set aside their differences. While Alistair was wary of Alaric's tendencies, the shared goal of uncovering the mysteries of the Feywild provided a common purpose that bound them together.

As Alistair and Alaric journeyed together, their dynamic was a mix of camaraderie and tension. Alistair held the locket close, his attachment unbreakable, while Alaric's kleptomania occasionally caused friction. Yet, the shared goal of reaching the Feywild acted as a beacon, guiding them through challenges and obstacles.

\eject

\paragraph*{Enchanting Carnival} Their path eventually led them to a new destination - the Witchlight Carnival. The sound of music and laughter filled the air as they approached, signaling the arrival of the carnival. For Alistair and Alaric, this was not just another carnival - it was a stepping stone on their journey to the Feywild, a realm of dreams and mysteries waiting to be unveiled.

As they entered the carnival's enchanting realm, they were both acutely aware that their alliance held the potential to lead them to the heart of the Feywild itself. The locket's whispering enchantment was a constant reminder of the destiny that awaited them - one of discovery, danger, and the intertwining of their fates.

And so, under the starlit sky, Alistair and Alaric explored their surroundings, united by the allure of the Feywild and the shared pursuit of the mysteries behind the Enchanted Locket of Lysandra. At the Witchlight Carnival their journey was about to take an unexpected turn, where the lines between reality and enchantment would blur, and the whimsy of the Feywild would guide them toward their destiny.

\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{Tiefling Traits}
\subsection*{Darkvision}
Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
\subsection*{Hellish Resistance}
You have resistance to fire damage.
\subsection*{Infernal Legacy}
You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Hellish Rebuke spell once as a 2nd-level spell. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the Darkness spell once. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

\section*{Court Functionary}
Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are.

\section*{Silver Tongued}
\subsection*{Charismatic Presence}
You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill if you don't already have it. If you already have proficiency in Persuasion, you gain expertise in that skill, doubling your proficiency bonus for ability checks made with it.
\subsection*{Charming Words}
You can spend 10 minutes engaging in conversation with a creature you can see, and if the creature's Intelligence is 6 or higher, you can attempt to charm it. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the creature's Wisdom saving throw. If you succeed, the creature becomes charmed by you for 1 hour or until you or your companions harm it. The DM determines the specifics of the creature's behavior while charmed.
\subsection*{Eloquent Performer}
When you use the Performance skill to entertain, inspire, or captivate an audience, your performance is exceptionally compelling. You have advantage on Performance checks made to impress or engage a crowd.

\section*{Bard}
\subsection*{Bardic Inspiration}
You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

(\textbf{Usages: \intcalcAdd{0}{\calculateModifier{\CharismaScoreValue}}})
\subsection*{Jack-of-All-Trades}
Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.
\subsection*{Song of Rest}
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra Hit Points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.
\subsection*{Bard College of Whispers}
\subsubsection*{Psychic Blades}
When you join the College of Whispers at 3rd level, you gain the ability to make your weapon attacks magically toxic to a creature's mind.

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage to that target. You can do so only once per round on your turn.

The psychic damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.

\subsubsection*{Words of Terror}
At 3rd level, you learn to infuse innocent-seeming words with an insidious magic that can inspire terror.

If you speak to a humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.

If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest or long rest.
\subsection*{Charm of the Monarch}
You can sprout a pair of beautiful butterfly wings, you gain flying speed equal to your walking speed, and you gain a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour. After you use this charm two times, it vanishes from you.\\

  {V}
  {Instantaneous}

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take \DndDice{1d4} psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

\subsection*{Level 1}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Charm Person}
  {1st Level Enchantment}
  {1 Action}
  {30 feet}
  {V, S}
  {1 hour}

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Dissonant Whispers}
  {1st Level Enchantment}
  {1 Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V}
  {Instantaneous}

You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes \DndDice{3d6} psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by \DndDice{1d6} for each slot level above 1st.

\DndSpellHeader

  {1 Action}
  {90 feet}
  {V, S}
  {Concentration, Up to 1 Minute}
  
Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.\\
A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.\\
When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Faerie Fire}
  {1st-Level Evocation}
  {1 Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V}
  {Concentration, up to 1 Minute}

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Feather Fall}
  {1st-Level Transmutation}
  {1 Reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls}
  {60 feet}
  {V, M (A small feather or piece of down)}
  {1 Minute}

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Healing Word}
  {1st Level Evocation}
  {1 Bonus Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V}
  {Instantaneous}

A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to \DndDice{1d4} + your spellcasting ability modifier \textbf{(+\intcalcAdd{0}{\calculateModifier{\CharismaScoreValue}})}. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the Healing increases by \DndDice{1d4} for each slot level above 1st.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Hellish Rebuke}
  {1st Level Evocation}
  {1 Reaction, which you take in response to being damaged by a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see}
  {60 feet}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes \DndDice{2d10} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by \DndDice{1d10} for each slot level above 1st.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Protection from Evil and Good}
  {1st Level Abjuration}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (Holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)}
  {Concentration, Up to 10 Minutes}
  
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.\\
The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Speak with Animals}
  {1st Level Divination (Ritual)}
  {1 Action}
  {Self}
  {V, S}
  {10 Minutes}
  
You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day.

  {Concentration, Up to 1 Hour}
  
A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Levitate}
  {2nd Level Transmutation}
  {1 Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V, S, M (Either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)}
  {Concentration, Up to 10 Minutes}
  
One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.\\
The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.\\
When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Shatter}
  {2nd Level Evocation}
  {1 Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V, S, M (A chip of mica)}
  {Instantaneous}

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes \DndDice{3d8} thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by \DndDice{1d8} for each slot level above 2nd.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Suggestion}
  {2nd Level Enchantment}
  {1 Action}
  {30 feet}
  {V, M (A snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)}
  {Concentration, Up to 8 Hours}

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.\\
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\\
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.\\
If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

\subsection*{Level 3}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Fly}
  {3rd Level Transmutation}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (A wing feather from any bird)}
  {Concentration, Up to 10 Minutes}
  
You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Meld into Trees}
  {3rd Level Transmutation (Ritual)}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S}
  {8 Hours}
  
You step into a tree object or surface large enough to fully contain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the tree for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the tree at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.
While merged with the tree, you can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the tree. You can use your movement to leave the tree where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.
Minor physical damage to the tree doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The tree's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.

\end{tikzpicture}
\vspace*{10.5cm}\\
An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college.

\section*{Appearance}
The "Fochlucan Bandore" is a mesmerizing musical instrument that beautifully merges the traditional forms of a bandore and a lute. It features an elegantly curved body, reminiscent of a bandore, but extends into a longer, slender neck characteristic of a lute, culminating in a distinctively crafted headstock. The instrument's surface is a canvas of intricate carvings and inlays, depicting mystical symbols and ancient runes, hinting at its magical origins. Its rich, warm wood tones are accentuated by a deep varnish, giving it an antique yet well-maintained appearance. Perhaps its most striking feature is its shimmering, light-like strings, adding a magical quality to its already ethereal aesthetic. This blend of artistic beauty, arcane significance, and ancient tradition renders the Fochlucan Bandore not just a musical instrument, but a remarkable piece of art and a mystical artifact, resonating with an aura of age-old lore and enchantment.

\section*{Arcane Challenge}
A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.

\section*{Charming Harmony}
You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

\section*{Spellcasting Ability}
You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
\subsection*{Standard Spells for Bard Instruments}
All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: Fly, Invisibility, Levitate, and Protection from Evil and Good.
\subsection*{Unique Spells of the Fochlucan Bandore}
In addition, the Fochlucan Bandore can be used to cast Entangle, Faerie Fire, Shillelagh, and Speak with Animals.

\chapter*{Ring of the Feywild Dryads}
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture, overlay]
	\node[xshift=3.25cm, yshift=0.8cm] {\textit{Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)}};
	\node[xshift=3.5cm, yshift=-6cm] {\includegraphics[width=1.3\columnwidth]{images/Ring_of_Meld_into_Trees.png}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\vspace*{12.5cm}
\section*{Appearance}
The "Ring of the Feywild Dryads" appears as a masterfully crafted piece of ancient magic and natural wonder. The band, formed from what seems to be twisted silver, mimics the intricate intertwining of tree branches, encircling the finger with a grace that speaks of the forest's deep and mystic ties. This silver has been textured to resemble bark, enhancing its bond with the trees it represents. At the heart of the ring, a large, captivating emerald sits prominently, its deep green hue glowing softly as if lit from within, symbolizing the life force of the forest and the essence of tree magic. Delicate Elvish runes, suggestive of enchantment and age-old secrets, are engraved along the band, hinting at the ring's ancient origins and its potent ability to connect the wearer with the natural world. This ring is not merely an accessory but a powerful artifact that embodies the spirit of the forest and the magic of melding with trees.
\section*{History}
The "Ring of the Feywild Dryads" is not merely a magical item; it is a relic of deep history and symbiotic power, born from the ancient alliance between the mortal realms and the feywilds. Crafted in an age long forgotten, under the boughs of the Eternal Forest in the heart of the feywilds, this ring was a gift from the dryads to the first of the Elven druids who walked the path between worlds.

The dryads, spirits of the trees, and guardians of the forest's deepest magics, sought to imbue this ring with the essence of their being and the forests they protect. Using silver that was mined from the sacred mountains surrounding the Eternal Forest and blessed by the light of the full moon, the ring was forged in the shape of intertwining branches, a symbol of life's complexity and interconnection. The centerpiece, a radiant emerald, was chosen for its resemblance to the heart of the forest - a gem that had captured the very essence of the feywild's verdant splendor.

Upon its creation, the Ring of the Feywild Dryads was bestowed upon an elf, chosen for their unwavering dedication to protecting the natural world. This elf, a druid of unparalleled connection to the earth's rhythms and cycles, became the first of many guardians who would wield the ring's power to merge with the trees, learning their secrets, and protecting the forests from those who would do them harm.

Over the centuries, the ring passed from one guardian to another, always finding its way to those who had proven themselves protectors of nature's sanctity. Each bearer left their mark on the ring, contributing to its legacy and the stories it holds within. Legends say that the ring still carries the whispers of the dryads and the echoes of the Eternal Forest, guiding its wearer not only to meld into trees but to understand the very language of the forest.

Today, the "Ring of the Feywild Dryads" remains a bridge between the mortal realms and the enchantments of the feywilds, a testament to the enduring alliance between the elves and the dryads. It is a reminder of the deep bonds that can form when different beings unite in a common cause, protecting the natural world and preserving its wonders for generations to come.
\section*{Magic}
While attuned to the ring, its wearer can cast the "Meld into Trees" spell once per long rest.

\chapter*{The Enchanted Locket of Lysandra}
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture, overlay]
	\node[xshift=3cm, yshift=0.8cm] {\textit{Locket, rare (requires attunement)}};
	\node[xshift=3.5cm, yshift=-5cm] {\includegraphics[width=1.3\columnwidth]{images/Locket_of_Lysandra.png}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\vspace*{10cm}
\section*{Appearance}
The Enchanted Locket of Lysandra appears as a simple and unadorned silver locket on a delicate chain. To the casual observer, it looks like an ordinary piece of jewelry with no special significance. However, upon closer inspection, however, the true magic of the locket becomes apparent. Faint, ever-shifting patterns of light dance across its surface like playful fireflies on a warm summer night. These ethereal luminescent swirls seem to weave intricate stories, their fleeting forms conjuring images of blooming wildflowers, starlit skies, and the elusive spirits of the Feywild. Each flicker of light holds a hint of forgotten tales, a connection to a realm of dreams that exists just beyond the veil of perception.

Adding to the intrigue, the locket possesses a set of minuscule, intricately wrought hinges that are barely discernible to the naked eye. These hinges, delicate as the gossamer wings of a butterfly, are an enigma in themselves, for they hint at the locket's potential to open and reveal its secrets. Yet, despite their apparent purpose, there is no physical means or any clue to unlocking the locket's hidden interior. It remains a tantalizing riddle, waiting for the touch of someone who holds both the key and the knowledge to unlock its mysteries.
\eject
\section*{History}
Legends speak of Lysandra, a powerful and enigmatic fey enchantress who once roamed the realms of Prismeer. Known for her boundless curiosity and mischievous nature, Lysandra was said to possess an item of unimaginable enchantment, capable of granting its bearer unparalleled insight into the secrets of the Feywild. The Enchanted Locket is believed to be a fragment of her lost legacy.
\vspace*{-1.2\fontdimen6\font}
\section*{Magic}
The locket has several magical properties, though Alistair might not be aware of all its abilities at the start of the campaign. As he uncover mores about the relic, he will discover its true potential. Some of its known abilities include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Fey Sensitivity:} The locket resonates with the energy of the Feywild, allowing its bearer to sense the presence of fey creatures and magical phenomena nearby. However, at times the holder becomes increasingly fixated on uncovering its secrets, neglecting other aspects of their life and their original quest. They might struggle to focus on anything else, including the well-being of their companions.
	\item \textbf{Dreams of the Fey:} When worn during sleep, the locket can grant visions and cryptic dreams about the Feywild, which become more unsettling as the influence of the locket grows.
	\item \textbf{Portal Attunement:} The locket can attune its bearer to specific Feywild locations, potentially serving as a key to unlock hidden pathways between the material world and the Feywild. But this bond could attract the attention of malevolent fey entities. These entities might attempt to manipulate or coerce your character into serving their own mysterious agendas.
	\item \textbf{Whisper of Lysandra:} In moments of uncertainty or danger, the locket may emit soft whispers of ancient Feywild wisdom, guiding its bearer's decisions - either helpful or malicious.
	\item \textbf{Mistrust of Mortals:} The locket's connection to the Feywild might foster a growing sense of alienation from the mortal world. The holder becomes more distant from non-fey creatures, finding it difficult to trust them.
	\item \textbf{Fading Identity:} As your character delves deeper into the locket's mysteries, they might find aspects of their identity beginning to blur. Memories of their life before the locket's influence become hazy, leading to a sense of disconnection from their past.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Compulsion}
The Enchanted Locket has a subtle yet powerful compulsion on its bearer. As your character carries the locket, its magic gradually influences their emotions and desires, kindling an insatiable fascination with the Feywild. The more they interact with the Feywild or embark on quests related to Prismeer, the stronger this compulsion becomes.

The locket's influence amplifies its bearer's natural magical inclinations, deepening his understanding of arcane secrets and Feywild lore. This newfound magical prowess enhances the Charismatic abilities of its bearer:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\ast$] \textbf{Level 4-6:} You gain a +1 bonus to Charisma ability checks while being attuned to the locket.
	\item \textbf{Level 7-11:} You gain a +2 bonus to Charisma ability checks and a -1 malus to Wisdom ability checks while being attuned to the locket.
	\item \textbf{Level 11-16:} You gain a +3 bonus to Charisma ability checks and a -1 malus to Wisdom ability checks while being attuned to the locket.
	\item \textbf{Level 17+:} You gain a +4 bonus to Charisma ability checks and a -2 malus to Wisdom ability checks while being attuned to the locket.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Curse of Whispered Entanglement}
The Enchanted Locket of Lysandra, despite its allure, carries a hidden curse that intertwines the bearer's fate with the whims of the Feywild. While the locket's charisma-enhancing effects are a boon, the Curse of Whispered Entanglement gradually begins to exert its influence, whispering subtle manipulations into the bearer's mind.

\paragraph*{Curse}
Once the character is attuned to this locket, he can not willingly unattune off it unless he is targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic.

\paragraph{Compelled Decision}
Whenever a decision must be made or information is sought, the locket's magic compels the bearer to heed its suggestions. The Dungeon Master decides what the locket suggests in each situation. The bearer must succeed a Charisma Saving Throw for any decision the locket suggests or a Wisdom Saving Throw for any information the locket reveals. If the saving throw fails, the bearer is fully convinced by the locket's suggestion and feels compelled to act on it. If the saving throw is successful, the bearer can resist the locket's influence and make their own decision. The DC is increasing by the following means:
\eject
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Save DC starts at a value of 10
	\item With every successful Saving Throw regarding this effect the bearer makes the Save DC increases by \xdef\successIncrease{0.5}\successIncrease
	\item With every failed Saving Throw regarding this effect the bearer makes the Save DC increases by \xdef\failIncrease{0.25}\failIncrease
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Failed Saves:} \xdef\failedSaves{5}\failedSaves\\
\textbf{Successful Saves:} \xdef\successSaves{4}\successSaves\\
\textbf{Current Save DC: \FPeval{saveDC}{clip(10+\failedSaves*failIncrease+\successSaves*\successIncrease)}\saveDC}
\section*{Torn between Worlds}
While the locket provides Alistair with extraordinary insights and magical abilities, its influence comes at a cost. The more time he spends away from the Feywild or the locket, the more he feels an ache of longing and a sense of restlessness. Their connection with the locket intertwines his fate with that of the Feywild, making him feel incomplete whenever he is separated from it.
\section*{Quest of Discovery}
The Enigmatic Locket of Lysandra possesses an inherent, magical allure that captivates the heart and mind of Alistair, the Bard. When he first encountered the locket, he was drawn to it by an irresistible pull, not fully comprehending why it called to him so strongly. From that moment on, he found himself becoming increasingly obsessed with uncovering the locket's true nature and its connection to the Feywild.
