\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{Tiefling Traits}
\subsection*{Darkvision}
Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
\subsection*{Hellish Resistance}
You have resistance to fire damage.
\subsection*{Infernal Legacy}
You know the Thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Hellish Rebuke spell once as a 2nd-level spell. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the Darkness spell once. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

\section*{Court Functionary}
Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are.

\section*{Silver Tongued}
\subsection*{Charismatic Presence}
You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill if you don't already have it. If you already have proficiency in Persuasion, you gain expertise in that skill, doubling your proficiency bonus for ability checks made with it.
\subsection*{Charming Words}
You can spend 10 minutes engaging in conversation with a creature you can see, and if the creature's Intelligence is 6 or higher, you can attempt to charm it. Make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the creature's Wisdom saving throw. If you succeed, the creature becomes charmed by you for 1 hour or until you or your companions harm it. The DM determines the specifics of the creature's behavior while charmed.
\subsection*{Eloquent Performer}
When you use the Performance skill to entertain, inspire, or captivate an audience, your performance is exceptionally compelling. You have advantage on Performance checks made to impress or engage a crowd.

\section*{Bard}
\subsection*{Bardic Inspiration}
You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

(\textbf{Usages: \intcalcAdd{0}{\calculateModifier{\CharismaScoreValue}}})
\subsection*{Jack-of-All-Trades}
Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.
\subsection*{Song of Rest}
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra Hit Points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.
%\subsection*{Bard College of Lore}
%Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.
%
%The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.
%
%The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.
%\subsubsection*{Cutting Words}
%Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

\subsection*{Level 1}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Charm Person}
  {1st Level Enchantment}
  {1 Action}
  {30 feet}
  {V, S}
  {1 hour}

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Dissonant Whispers}
  {1st Level Enchantment}
  {1 Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V}
  {Instantaneous}

You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes \DndDice{3d6} psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by \DndDice{1d6} for each slot level above 1st.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Faerie Fire}
  {1st-Level Evocation}
  {1 Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V}
  {Concentration, up to 1 minute}

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Healing Word}
  {1st Level Evocation}
  {1 Bonus Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V}
  {Instantaneous}

A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit points equal to \DndDice{1d4} + spell attack bonus {\intcalcAdd{\ProficiencyValue}{\calculateModifier{\CharismaScoreValue}}}. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the Healing increases by \DndDice{1d4} for each slot level above 1st.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Hellish Rebuke}
  {1st Level Evocation}
  {1 Reaction, which you take in response to being damaged by a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see}
  {60 feet}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes \DndDice{2d10} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by \DndDice{1d10} for each slot level above 1st.

\subsection*{Level 2}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Shatter}
  {2nd Level Evocation}
  {1 Action}
  {60 feet}
  {V, S, M (A chip of mica)}
  {Instantaneous}

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes \DndDice{3d8} thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by \DndDice{1d8} for each slot level above 2nd.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Suggestion}
  {2nd Level Enchantment}
  {1 Action}
  {30 feet}
  {V, M (A snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)}
  {Concentration, Up to 8 hours}

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.\\
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.\\
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed.\\
If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

\chapter*{The Enchanted Locket of Lysandra}
\section*{Appearance}
The Enchanted Locket of Lysandra appears as a simple and unadorned silver locket on a delicate chain. To the casual observer, it looks like an ordinary piece of jewelry with no special significance. However, upon closer inspection, faint, ever-shifting patterns of light dance across its surface, hinting at its magical nature.
\section*{History}
Legends speak of Lysandra, a powerful and enigmatic fey enchantress who once roamed the realms of Prismeer. Known for her boundless curiosity and mischievous nature, Lysandra was said to possess an item of unimaginable enchantment, capable of granting its bearer unparalleled insight into the secrets of the Feywild. The Enchanted Locket is believed to be a fragment of her lost legacy.
\section*{Magic}
The locket has several magical properties, though Alistair might not be aware of all its abilities at the start of the campaign. As he uncover mores about the relic, he will discover its true potential. Some of its known abilities include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Fey Sensitivity:} The locket resonates with the energy of the Feywild, allowing its bearer to sense the presence of fey creatures and magical phenomena nearby. However, at times the holder becomes increasingly fixated on uncovering its secrets, neglecting other aspects of their life and their original quest. They might struggle to focus on anything else, including the well-being of their companions.
	\item \textbf{Dreams of the Fey:} When worn during sleep, the locket can grant visions and cryptic dreams about the Feywild, which become more unsettling as the influence of the locket grows.
	\item \textbf{Portal Attunement:} The locket can attune its bearer to specific Feywild locations, potentially serving as a key to unlock hidden pathways between the material world and the Feywild. But this bond could attract the attention of malevolent fey entities. These entities might attempt to manipulate or coerce your character into serving their own mysterious agendas.
	\item \textbf{Whisper of Lysandra:} In moments of uncertainty or danger, the locket may emit soft whispers of ancient Feywild wisdom, guiding its bearer's decisions - either helpful or malicious.
	\item \textbf{Mistrust of Mortals:} The locket's connection to the Feywild might foster a growing sense of alienation from the mortal world. The holder becomes more distant from non-fey creatures, finding it difficult to trust them and feeling drawn toward their fey counterparts.
	\item \textbf{Fading Identity:} As your character delves deeper into the locket's mysteries, they might find aspects of their identity beginning to blur. Memories of their life before the locket's influence become hazy, leading to a sense of disconnection from their past.
\end{itemize}
Over time, the locket's influence amplifies Alistair's natural magical inclinations, deepening his understanding of arcane secrets and Feywild lore. This newfound magical prowess enhances his abilities as a Bard, granting him unique insights into ancient Feywild rituals, forgotten enchantments, and the intricacies of Feywild creatures.
\section*{Compulsion}
The Enchanted Locket has a subtle yet powerful compulsion on its bearer. As your character carries the locket, its magic gradually influences their emotions and desires, kindling an insatiable fascination with the Feywild. The more they interact with the Feywild or embark on quests related to Prismeer, the stronger this compulsion becomes.
\section*{Torn between Worlds}
While the locket provides Alistair with extraordinary insights and magical abilities, its influence comes at a cost. The more time he spends away from the Feywild or the locket, the more he feels an ache of longing and a sense of restlessness. Their connection with the locket intertwines his fate with that of the Feywild, making him feel incomplete whenever he is separated from it.
\section*{Quest of Discovery}
The Enigmatic Locket of Lysandra possesses an inherent, magical allure that captivates the heart and mind of Alistair, the Bard. When he first encountered the locket, he was drawn to it by an irresistible pull, not fully comprehending why it called to him so strongly. From that moment on, he found himself becoming increasingly obsessed with uncovering the locket's true nature and its connection to the Feywild.
