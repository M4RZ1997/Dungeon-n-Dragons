\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{Ranger}
\subsection*{Favored Enemy}
Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

\subsection*{Natural Explorer}
You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
	\item Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
	\item Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
	\item If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
	\item When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
	\item While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.
\end{itemize}
You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

\subsection*{Fighting Style}
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.

You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

\subsubsection*{Archery}
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

\subsection*{Ranger Archetypes}
The ideal of the ranger has classic expressions. These are detailed below.

\subsubsection*{Hunter}
Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.

\paragraph*{Hunter's Prey}
At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
\subparagraph*{Horde Breaker}
Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.
\paragraph*{Defensive Tactics}
At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
\subparagraph*{Escape the Horde}
Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.
\paragraph*{Multiattack}
At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.
\subparagraph*{Volley}
You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

\subsection*{Land's Stride}
Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical Difficult Terrain costs you no extra Movement. You can also pass through nonmagical Plants without being slowed by them and without Taking Damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on Saving Throws against Plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede Movement, such those created by the Entangle spell.

\subsection*{Hide in Plain Sight}
Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, Plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking ACTIONS. Once you move or take an Action or a Reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

\section*{Background}
\subsection*{Folk Hero}
You come from a humble social rank, but you are destined for so much more. Already the people of your home village regard you as their champion, and your destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and monsters that threaten the common folk everywhere.

\subparagraph*{Skill Proficiencies} Animal Handling, Survival
\subparagraph*{Tool Proficiencies} One type of artisan's tools, vehicles (land)
\subparagraph*{Equipment} A set of artisan’s tools (one of your choice), a shovel, an iron pot, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp

\section*{Feats}
\subsection*{Sharpshooter}
You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
  \item Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
  \item Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If that attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Wood Elf Magic}
You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn one Druid cantrip of your choice. You also learn the Longstrider and Pass Without Trace spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.

\section*{Magical Items}
\subsection*{Quiver of Ehlonna}
\textit{wondrous item, uncommon}

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.

\subsection*{Manual of Gainful Exercise (used)}
\textit{wondrous item, very rare}

This book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's Contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.

\section*{Spells}

\subsection*{Cantrips}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Chill Touch}
  {Necromancy Cantrip}
  {1 action}
  {120 feet}
  {V, S}
  {1 round}

You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of your next turn.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

\textbf{Abilities:}

  \item Twinned Spell
  \item Quickened Spell
  \item Spell Sniper

  {Eldrich Blast}
  {Evocation cantrip}
  {1 action}
  {120 feet}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.

The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams at the same target or different ones, make a separate attack roll for each beam.

\textbf{Abilities:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Quickened Spell
  \item Spell Sniper
\end{itemize}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Light}
  {Evocation Cantrip}
  {1 action}
  {Touch}
  {V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)}
  {1 hour}

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be coloured as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends when you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

\textbf{Abilities:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Heightened Spell
\end{itemize}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Mage Hand}
  {Conjuration Cantrip}
  {1 action}
  {30 feet}
  {V, S}
  {1 minute}

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

\subparagraph*{Abilities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Quickened Spell
\end{itemize}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Mending}
  {Transmutation Cantrip}
  {1 minute}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (Two lodestones)}
  {Instantaneous}

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin.

As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Message}
  {Transmutation Cantrip}
  {1 minute}
  {120 feet}
  {V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)}
  {1 round}

  You point your finger towards a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (abd only the target) hears your message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

  You can hear this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin slice of lead or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel around corners or through openings.

\subparagraph*{Abilities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Twined Spell
  \item Quickened Spell
\end{itemize}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Ray Of Frost}
  {Evocation Cantrip}
  {1 action}
  {60 feet}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

\subparagraph*{Abilities}

  {1st-level necromancy}
  {1 action}
  {Self}
  {V, S, M (A small amount of alcohol or distilled spirits)}
  {1 hour}

Bolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 1st.

\subparagraph*{Abilities}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Magic Missile}
  {1st-level evocation}
  {1 action}
  {120 ft}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

\subparagraph{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.

\subparagraph*{Abilities}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Scorching Ray}
  {2nd-level evocation}
  {1 action}
  {120 feet}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.

\subparagraph*{Abilities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Quickened Spell
  \item Spell Sniper
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Level 3}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Lightning Bolt}
  {3rd-level evocation}
  {1 action}
  {Self (100-foot line)}
  {V, S, M (A bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)}
  {Instantaneous}

A stroke of lightning forming a line of 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

\subparagraph*{Abilities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Heightened Spell
  \item Quickened Spell
  \item Spell Sniper
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Level 4}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Blight}
  {4th-level necromancy}
  {1 action}
  {30 feet}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs. 

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. 

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

\subparagraph*{Abilities}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Heightened Spell
  \item Twinned Spell
  \item Quickened Spell
\end{itemize}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Dominate Beast}
  {4th-level enchantment}
  {1 action}
  {60 feet}
  {V, S}
  {Concentration, up to 1 minute}

You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw. 

While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and  general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or  "Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. 

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the  target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well. 

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.  When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours

  {60 feet}

  {Concentration, up to 10 minutes}

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can effect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

\subparagraph*{Creature} You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward, but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained by your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.

On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

\subparagraph*{Object} You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being work or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability, contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.
