		{Thistlenight's pale, oaken body and silver-gray, moonlit eyes hint at their fey origins. Their wiry frame is wrapped in tattered, smoke-stained clothing, and white, uneven hair falls around their}{face. When the glamour fades, faint thorn-like markings appear on their arms and neck, a haunting reminder of their awakening.}
	}%
\AdditionalFeaturesAndTraits{
	When Thistlenight speaks, their voice carries a faint, almost imperceptible echo, like whispers lingering just beyond the edge of hearing. It is both haunting and mesmerizing, drawing listeners in while leaving an uneasy feeling in its wake. Those who stand close to them often shiver without explanation, as though a cold wind has brushed past, despite the stillness of the air.

	Plants in Thistlenight's presence seem to sense their fey magic - some wilt and wither as though recoiling from their aura, while others bloom unnaturally, stretching toward them as if seeking their attention. Even the smallest weed might twist and shudder faintly when they pass.

	When at rest, Thistlenight is unnaturally still, their body devoid of even the smallest fidget or breath-like movement. In these moments, they seem less a living being and more a shadow of something forgotten, tethered to the world by only the faintest thread of reality.

\Characterbackground{
	Swapped for a mortal child by the fairies, Thistlenight lived unnoticed among humans for years under the veil of fey glamour. As the magic faded, their foster parents realized the horrifying truth: their beloved child had been replaced by a wechselkind. Fear turned to violence as the parents tried to destroy the creature they saw as an abomination. But in that moment of betrayal, Thistlenight awakened, their latent magic surging forth. Thorned vines erupted, killing the parents in a moonless night of blood and terror.

	Taking the name "Thistlenight" to mark their dark awakening, they fled the mortal world, leaving behind the ruined house and the twisted remnants of their foster family.

	Now stranded in Sigil's Lower Wards after fleeing through a portal, Thistlenight struggles to survive in the smoke-filled alleys of the city. Their ability to mimic the child they replaced offers fleeting safety, but the glamour cannot hold forever. Using their fey-born magic of illusion and trickery, they navigate the brutal streets, avoiding bounty hunters and other dangers.
}
\Treasure{
	\textbf{1. Amber Necklace:} A tarnished bronze chain holds a smooth amber stone with a tiny, frozen insect trapped within. Worn and weathered, it radiates a faint warmth, as if it holds a quiet, hidden power. Thistlenight treasures it as the last remnant of their old life.\\
	\textbf{2. 8-Inch Glass Ant Figurine:} This delicate glass ant, eerily lifelike, catches light in faint rainbow hues. A small crack mars one of its legs, yet its weight feels oddly grounding in Thistlenight's hand.\\
	\textbf{3. Silver Fork with Bent Tines:} A tarnished silver fork with its outer tines bent sideways, bearing a faint, nearly illegible engraving. Its imperfections make it oddly compelling, and Thistlenight keeps it as an inexplicable token of resilience.
}

% PERSONALITY TRAITS
\PersonalityTraits{
	Thistlenight reads people with uncanny precision, trusting no one fully. They exude an unnerving calm, their soft voice both soothing and unsettling. A pragmatic survivor, they manipulate and deceive when needed but avoid unnecessary cruelty.
}
\Alignment{Chaotic Neutral}

\Ideals{
	\textbf{Survival Above All}\\"The world is cruel, and only the cunning survive. I'll do whatever it takes to endure."

\Bonds{
	\textbf{A Singular Focus}\\"Survival is my only bond. Until I am truly free, I cannot afford to care for anything else."

\Flaws{
	Anyone in a position of power immediately raises their suspicions, making it difficult for them to accept help or alliances.

\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{Wechselkind Traits}
Constructed of sturdy materials and enchanted with powerful faerie magic, wechselkind possess several traits that distinguish them from the other races of Etharis.
\subsection*{Artificial Form}
As a constructed creature, your body functions differently than a normal person.
\begin{itemize}
	\item You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
	\item You are immune to disease. You don't need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. You are still considered humanoid.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Faerie Glamour}
When the faerie leaves a wechselkind in place of a mortal child, they cover it with a glamour to make it appear identical to the child that was stolen. Over time this glamour fades, but a wechselkind can still call upon it in times of need.

You may cast the Disguise Self spell once with this trait, but only to take on the appearance of the child you were intended to replace, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
\subsection*{Childish Agility}
You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill.

\section*{Sorcerer Traits}
\subsection*{Innate Sorcery}
An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
	\item You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.
\end{itemize}
You can use this feature twice, and you regain expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.
\vfill\eject
\subsection*{Font of Magic}
You can tap into the wellspring within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcery Features table. You can't have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.

You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.

\paragraph*{Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points} You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot's level (no action required)

\paragraph*{Creating Spell Slots} As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slot table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Creating Spell Slots]{ccc}
	\textbf{Spell Slot Lvl} & \textbf{Sorcery Point Cost} & \textbf{Min. Sorcerer Lvl} \\
	1 & 2 & 2 \\
	2 & 3 & 3 \\
	3 & 5 & 5 \\
	4 & 6 & 7 \\
	5 & 7 & 9 \\
\end{DndTable}

\subsection*{Metamagic}
Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from "Metamagic Options" later in this class's description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don't know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.
\subsubsection*{Seeking Spell}
\textit{Cost: 1 Sorcery Point}\\
If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.

You can use Seeking Spell even if you've already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
\subsubsection*{Subtle Spell}
\textit{Cost: 1 Sorcery Point}\\
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.

\subsection*{Clockwork Sorcery}
The cosmic force of order has suffused you with magic. That power arises from Mechanus or a realm like it - a plane of existence shaped entirely by clockwork efficiency. You or someone from your lineage might have become entangled in the machinations of modrons, the orderly beings who inhabit Mechanus. Perhaps your ancestor even took part in the Great Modron March. Whatever its origin within you, the power of order can seem strange to others, but for you, it's part of a vast and glorios system.
\subsubsection*{Clockwork Spells}
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Clockwork Spells tablem you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Clockwork Spells]{llX}
			& \textbf{Sorcerer Level}	&\textbf{Spells}												\\
$\bullet$	& 3rd						&Aid, Alarm, Lesser Restoration, Protection from Evil and Good	\\
$\bullet$	& 5th						&Dispel Magic, Protection from Energy							\\
			& 7th						&Freedom of Movement, Summon Construct							\\
			& 9th						&Greater Restoration, Wall of Force								\\
\end{DndTable}
In addition, consult the Manifestation of Order table and choose or randomly determine a way your connection to order manifests while you are casting any of your Sorcerer spells.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Manifestations of Order]{llX}
			& \textbf{1d6}	&\textbf{Manifestation}\\
			& 1				&Spectral cogwheels hover behind you.\\
$\bullet$	& 2				&The hands of a clock spin in your eyes.\\
			& 3				&Your skin glows with a brassy sheen.\\
			& 4				&Floating equations and geometric objects overlay your body.\\
			& 5				&Your Spellcasting Focus temporarily takes the form of a Tiny clockwork mechanism.\\
			& 6				&The ticking of gears or ringing of a clock can be heard by you and those affected by your magic
\end{DndTable}
\subsubsection*{Restore Balance}
\textbf{4 Uses per Long Rest}\\
Your connection to the plane of absolute order allows you to equalize chaotic moments. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with Advantage or Disadvantage, you can take a Reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by Advantage and Disadvantage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
\subsubsection*{Bastion of Law}
You can tap into the grand equation of existence to imbue a creature with a shimmering shield of order. As a Magic action, you can expend 1 to 5 Sorcery Points to create a magical ward around yourself or another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The ward is represented by a number of d8s equal to the number of Sorcery Points spent to create it. When the warded creature takes damage, it can expend a number of those dice, roll them, and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled on those dice.

The ward lasts until you finish a Long Rest or until you use this feature again.
\subsubsection*{Sorcery Incarnate}
If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate.

In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic option on each spell you cast.

\section*{Spells}
\subsection*{Cantrips}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Chill Touch}
  {Necromancy Cantrip}
  {Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

Channeling the chill of the grave, make a melee spell attack against a target within reach. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 Necrotic damage and it can't regain Hit Points until the end of your next turn.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach \textbf{level 5 (2d10)}, 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10)

\DndSpellHeader
  {Elementalism}
  {Transmutation Cantrip}
  {Action}
  {30 Feet}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

You exert control over the elements, creating one of the following effects within range.
\paragraph*{Beckon Air} You create a breeze strong enough to ripple cloth, stir dust, rustle leaves, and close open doors and shutter, all in a 5-foot Cube. Doors and shutters being held open by someone or something aren't affected.
\paragraph*{Beckon Earth} You create a thin shroud of dust or sand that covers surfaces in a 5-foot-square area, or you cause a single word to appear in your handwriting in a patch of dirt or sand.
\paragraph*{Beckon Fire} You create a thin cloud of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in a 5-foot Cube. You choose the color and scent, and the embers can light candles, torches, or lamps in that area. The smoke's scent lingers for 1 minute.
\paragraph*{Beckon Water} You create a spray of cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects in a 5-foot Cube. Alternatively, you create 1 cup of clean water either in an open container or on a surface, and the water evaporates in 1 minute.
\paragraph*{Sculpt Element} You cause dirt, sand, fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot Cube to assume a crude shape (such as that of a creature) for 1 hour.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Infestation}
  {Conjuration Cantrip}
  {Action}
  {30 Feet}
  {V, S, M (a living flea)}
  {Instantaneous}

You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes 1d6 poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach \textbf{5th level (2d6)}, 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

\DndSpellHeader
  {Mage Hand}
  {Conjuration Cantrip}
  {Action}
  {30 Feet}
  {V, S}
  {1 Minute}

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Mind Sliver}
  {Enchantment Cantrip}
  {Action}
  {60 Feet}
  {V}
  {1 Round}

You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage and subtract 1d4 from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

\subparagraph*{At Higher Levels} This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels: \textbf{5th level (2d6)}, 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

\subsection*{1st Level}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Alarm}
  {1st-Level Abjuration (Ritual)}
  {1 Minute}
  {30 Feet}
  {V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)}
  {8 Hours}

You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot Cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental:
\paragraph*{Audible Alarm} The alarm produces the sound of the handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet if the warded area.
\paragraph*{Mental Alarm} You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you're asleep.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Charm Person}
  {1st-Level Enchantment}
  {Action}
  {30 Feet}
  {V, S}
  {1 Hour}

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Chromatic Orb}
  {1st-Level Evocation}
  {Action}
  {90 Feet}
  {V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 50 gp)}
  {Instantaneous}

You hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 damage of the chosen type.

If you roll the same number on two or more of the d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb can't leap again unless you cast the spell with a level 2+ spell slot.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 1. The orb can leap a maximum number of times equal to the level of the slot expended, and a creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Disguise Self}
  {1st-Level Illusion}
  {Action}
  {Self}
  {V, S}
  {1 Hour}

You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the Study action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

\DndSpellHeader
  {False Life}
  {1st-Level Necromancy}
  {Action}
  {Self}
  {V, S, M (a small amount of alcohol or distilled spirits)}
  {1 Hour}

You gain \DndDice{2d4 + 4} Temporary Hit Points.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} You gain 5 additional Temporary Hit Points for each spell slot level above 1.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Ice Knife}
  {1st-Level Conjuration}
  {Action}
  {60 Feet}
  {S, M (a drop of water or piece of ice)}
  {Instantaneous}

You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 Piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of the point where the ice exploded must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 Cold damage.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} The Cold damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Protection from Evil \& Good}
  {1st-Level Abjuration}
  {Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (a flask of Holy Water worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)}
  {Concentration, Up to 10 Minutes}

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against creatures that are Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have Disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be possessed by or gain the Charmed or Frightened conditions from them. If the target is already possessed, Charmed, or Frightened by such a creature, the target has Advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

\subsection*{2nd Level}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Aid}
  {2nd-Level Abjuration}
  {Action}
  {30 Feet}
  {V, S, M (a strip of white cloth)}
  {8 Hours}

Choose up to three creatures within range. Each target's Hit Point maximum and current Hit Points increase by 5 for the duration.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} Each target's Hit Points increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 2.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Cloud of Daggers}
  {2nd-Level Conjuration}
  {Action}
  {60 Feet}
  {V, S, M (a sliver of glass)}
  {Concentration, Up to 1 Minute}

You fill the air with spinning daggers in a cube 5 feet on each side, centered on a point you choose within range. A creature takes 4d4 slashing damage when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Dragon's Breath}
  {2nd-Level Transmutation}
  {Bonus Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (a hot pepper)}
  {Concentration, Up to 1 Minute}

You touch one willing creature and imbue it with the power to spew magical energy from its mouth, provided it has one. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. Until the spell ends, the creature can use an action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Lesser Restoration}
  {2nd-Level Abjuration}
  {Bonus Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

You touch a creature and end one condition on it: Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, or Poisoned.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Phantasmal Force}
  {2nd-Level Illusion}
  {Action}
  {60 Feet}
  {V, S, M (a bit of fleece)}
  {Concentration, Up to 1 Minute}

You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only to the creature.

The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.

While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall; it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

\subsection*{3rd Level}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Antagonize}
  {3rd-Level Enchantment}
  {Action}
  {30 Feet}
  {V, S, M (a playing card depicting a rogue)}
  {Instantaneous}

You whisper magical words that antagonize one creature of your choice within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d4 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of your choice that you can see. If the target can't make this attack (for example, because there is no one within its reach or because its reaction is unavailable), the target instead has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Dispel Magic}
  {3rd-Level Abjuration}
  {Action}
  {120 Feet}
  {V, S}
  {Instantaneous}

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any ongoing spell of level 3 or lower on the target ends. For each ongoing spell of level 4 or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability (Dc 10 plus that spell's level). On a successful check, the spell ends.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} You automatically end a spell on the target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you use.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Melf's Minute Meteors}
  {3rd-Level Evocation}
  {Action}
  {Self}
  {V, S, M (niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead)}
  {Concentration, Up to 10 Minutes}

You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell — and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter — you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Protection from Energy}
  {3rd-Level Abjuration}
  {Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S}
  {Concentration, Up to 1 Hour}

For the duration, the willing creature you touch has Resistance to one damage type of your choice: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Vampiric Touch}
  {3rd-Level Necromancy}
  {Action}
  {Self}
  {V, S}
  {Concentration, Up to 1 Minute}

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a Magic action, targeting the same creature or a different one.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 3.

\subsection*{4th Level}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Dominate Beast}
  {4th-Level Enchantment}
  {Action}
  {60 Feet}
  {V, S}
  {Concentration, Up to 1 Minute}

You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.

While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature", "Run over there", or "Fetch that object". If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Freedom of Movement}
  {4th-Level Abjuration}
  {Action}
  {Touch}
  {V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)}
  {1 Hour}
  
You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Summon Construct}
  {4th-Level Conjuration}
  {Action}
  {90 Feet}
  {V, S, M (a lockbox worth 400+ GP)}
  {Concentration, up to 1 Hour}
  
You call forth the spirit of a construct. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Construct Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose a material: Clay, Metal, or Stone. The creature resembles a golem or a modron (your choice) made of the chosen material, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

\subparagraph*{Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot} Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
