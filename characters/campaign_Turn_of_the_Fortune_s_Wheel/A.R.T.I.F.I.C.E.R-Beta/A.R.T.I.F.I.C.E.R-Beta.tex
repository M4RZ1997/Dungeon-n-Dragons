		{A.R.T.I.F.I.C.E.R-$\beta$ is a hulking, weathered autognome with mismatched plates, exposed gears, and a single glowing ocular lens. Rust streaks its crude frame, but its toolbelt and alchemical vials reveal its role as a master craftsman. Despite its rugged design, $\beta$ exudes intelligence and purpose, embodying its legacy as an artificer and weapon shopkeeper.}
	}%
\Characterbackground{
	A.R.T.I.F.I.C.E.R-$\beta$ is the second prototype in the Automated Robotic Technician Infused with Focused Intelligence \& Craftsmanship for Exploration and Reconnaissance series, created by the brilliant Lantanna artificer G.E. Petto. Designed to assist Lantanna magicians with crafting magical defenses and intricate constructs, A.R.T.I.F.I.C.E.R constructs rarely saw use in battle. As the robotic line advanced, $\beta$ and his kin were deemed obsolete. Most were dismantled and destroyed to make way for newer models.

G.E. Petto, however, could not bring himself to destroy $\beta$, who had served him with unwavering loyalty for many decades. As an act of mercy and affection, Petto gifted $\beta$ with full sentience and autonomy, allowing the construct to escape before its fate was sealed. With newfound freedom, $\beta$ wandered the Forgotten Realms for decades, traveling from the islands of Lantan to distant, unfamiliar realms.

Eventually, $\beta$ found his way to Sigil, the City of Doors, and settled in the bustling Market Ward. There, he established a workshop that quickly became the talk of the district. His ingenious creations - ranging from useful, autonomous constructs to powerful ballistae and artillery - earned him both fame and respect. Despite his rugged and outdated appearance, $\beta$’s craftsmanship and ingenuity rival that of the most advanced artificers.
}
\AlliesAndOrganizations{
	The Artificer Guild of Lantan is a prestigious and enigmatic organization dedicated to the fusion of magic and engineering, embodying the inventive spirit of the island nation. Renowned across Faerûn, the guild operates from their intricate headquarters, the High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration, the heart of Gond's church in the Realms. Its members, a mix of brilliant gnomes and humans, strive to push the boundaries of artifice, crafting magical constructs, experimental devices, and enchanted tools.

	The guild's primary goals include advancing the knowledge of magical and mechanical innovation, preserving\linebreak
}{Lantan's unique technological heritage, and influencing the wider world through their creations. Their relentless pursuit of progress sometimes raises ethical questions, as their experiments occasionally blur the line between invention and peril.}

\AdditionalFeaturesAndTraits{
	When A.R.T.I.F.I.C.E.R-$\beta$ delves into a project or sinks into deep thought, the intricate gears and mechanical contraptions within his body begin to whir and rotate, a mesmerizing rhythm akin to the heartbeat of his mechanical core. His brass plating, though worn and weathered, tells its own story - pockmarked with countless dents and scratches, each one a silent testament to the trials and travels he has endured across the realms. At times, faint hisses of steam escape from tiny vents on his shoulders, a subtle reminder of the immense energy coursing through his ancient frame. These small, almost organic details make $\beta$ more than just a construct; they make him a relic of the past and a living piece of artifice, imbued with purpose and life.
}
\Treasure{
	\textbf{1. Portrait of G.E. Petto:} A finely etched metal portrait of his creator, G.E. Petto, framed in delicate brass gears. The portrait is enchanted to faintly glow when $\beta$ gazes at it, a subtle connection to the man who gave him life. $\beta$ keeps this portrait on a prominent wall in his workshop as both a tribute and a source of guidance during moments of doubt.\\
	\textbf{2. Blueprint of Dreams:} A large, rolled blueprint of an unfinished construct designed by G.E. Petto. The design is incomplete, and $\beta$ has been trying for years to decipher its purpose. He believes it might hold the secret to something extraordinary but refuses to let anyone else see it.\\
	\textbf{3. Animated Gear Wall:} A decorative yet functional wall in his workshop covered in interconnected gears, each inscribed with Lantanna runes. These gears spin in mesmerizing patterns, powered by ambient magic, and serve as both a piece of art and a reminder of his mechanical nature.

% PERSONALITY TRAITS
\PersonalityTraits{
	He has a habit of salvaging interesting components from the things he encounters, storing them in hidden compartments in his frame. His workshop is filled with odd bits of scrap that only he seems to understand the purpose of.
}
\Alignment{Lawful Neutral}

\Ideals{
	$\beta$ has an unshakable belief in the value of craftsmanship and treats even the smallest projects with reverence.
}

\Bonds{
	$\beta$ occasionally reminisces about his time in Lantan, sharing cryptic stories about his master or the other constructs that were destroyed.
}

\Flaws{
	$\beta$ carries guilt for surviving when his fellow constructs were destroyed, causing moments of hesitation and doubt.

\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{Autognome Traits}
\subsection*{Built for Success}
You can add a d4 to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make, and you can do so after seeing the d20 roll but before the effects of the roll are resolved. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
\subsection*{Healing Machine}
If the Mending spell is cast on you, you can spend a Hit Die, roll it, and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). In addition, your creator designed you to benefit from several spells that preserve life but that normally don't affect Constructs: Cure Wounds, Healing Word, Mass Cure Wounds, Mass Healing Word, and Spare the Dying.
\subsection*{Mechanical Nature}
You have resistance to poison damage and immunity to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed or poisoned. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
\subsection*{Sentry's Rest}
When you take a long rest, you spend at least 6 hours in an inactive, motionless state, instead of sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but you remain conscious.

\section*{Artificer Traits}
\subsection*{Magical Tinkering}
At 1st level, you've learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
	\item Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
	\item The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
	\item A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.
\end{itemize}
The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.
\subsection*{Infuse Item}
\textbf{6 Known, 3 Infused Items at a time}\\
At 2nd level, you've gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.
\subsubsection*{Infusions Known}
\paragraph*{Enhanced Arcane Focus}\hfill\\
\textit{Item: A rod, staff or wand (requires attunement)}\\
While holding this item, a creature gains +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, the creature ignores half cover when making a spell attack.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.
\paragraph*{Enhanced Defense}\hfill\\
\textit{Item: A suit of armor or a shield}\\
A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.
\paragraph*{Enhanced Weapon}\hfill\\
\textit{Item: A simple or martial weapon}\\
This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.
\paragraph*{Homunculus Servant}\hfill\\
\textit{Item: A gem or crystal worth at least 100gp}\\
You learn intricate methods for magically creating a special homunculus that serves you. The item you infuse serves as the creature's heart, around which the creature's body instantly forms.

You determine the homunculus's appearance. Some artificers prefer mechanical-looking birds, whereas some like winged vials or miniature, animate cauldrons.

The homunculus is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

The homunculus regains 2d6 hit points if the mending spell is cast on it. If you or the homunculus dies, it vanishes, leaving its heart in its space.

\end{DndMonster}
\paragraph*{Resistant Armor}\hfill\\
\textit{Item: A Suit or Armor (requires attunement)}\\
While wearing this armor, a creature has resistance to one of the following damage types, which you choose when you infuse the item: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder.
\paragraph*{Spell-Refueling Ring}\hfill\\
\textit{Item: A Ring (requires attunement)}\\
While wearing this ring, the creature can recover one expended spell slot as an action. The recovered slot can be of 3rd level or lower. Once used, the ring can't be used again until the next dawn.
\paragraph*{Eyes of Minute Seeing}\hfill\\
\textit{Item: Any spectacles or goggles}\\
While wearing these lenses you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within range.
\subsubsection*{Infusing an Item}
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.
\subsection*{Artillerist}
\subsubsection*{Artillerist Spells}
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Artillerist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Artillerist Spells]{llX}
			& \textbf{Artificer Level}  &\textbf{Spells}				\\
$\bullet$	& 3rd						&Shield, Thunderwave			\\
$\bullet$	& 5th						&Scorching Ray, Shatter			\\
			& 9th						&Fireball, Wind Wall			\\
			& 13th						&Ice Storm, Wall of Fire		\\
			& 17th						&Cone of Cold, Wall of Force	\\
\end{DndTable}
\subsubsection*{Eldritch Cannon}
Also at 3rd level, you've learned how to create a magical cannon. Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand. Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present.

The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Eldritch Cannon]{lX}
\textbf{Cannon}  	&\textbf{Activation}				\\
Flamethrower		&The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.\\
Force Ballista		&Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon.\\
Protector			&The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).\\
\end{DndTable}
When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.
\subsubsection*{Arcane Firearm}
At 5th level, You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarver's tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff, or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely.

You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.
\subsection*{The Right Tool for the Job}
At 3rd level, you've learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.
\subsection*{Tool Expertise}
At 6th level, your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.
\subsection*{Flash of Genius}
\textbf{\intcalcAdd{0}{\calculateModifier{\IntelligenceScoreValue}} Uses}\\
At 7th level, you've gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

\subsection*{Eyes of Minute Seeing}
\textit{Wondrous Item, uncommon}\\
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.
\subsection*{Robe of Useful Items}
\textit{Wondrous Item, uncommon}\\
This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe. you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.

The robe has two of each of the following patches:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dagger
	\item Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)
	\item Steel mirror
	\item 10-foot pole
	\item Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled)
	\item Sack (1/2)
\end{itemize}
In addition, the robe has 4d4 (10) other patches.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Window
	\item Iron Door
	\item Rowboat
	\item Portable Ram
	\item 2x Potion of Healing
	\item 10 gems worth 100gp
	\item Pit
	\item Magic Missile Scroll
	\item Shield Scroll
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Cube of Force}
\textit{Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)}\\
This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.

You can use an action to press one of the cube's faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube's sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Cube of Force Faces]{llX}
	Face  	& Charges  	& Effect \\
	1		& 1			& Gases, wind, and fog can't pass through the barrier.\\
	2		& 2			& Non-living matter can't pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.\\
	3		& 3			& Living matter can't pass through the barrier.\\
	4		& 4			& Spell effects can't pass through the barrier.\\
	5		& 5			& Nothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.\\
	6		& 0			& The barrier deactivates.\\
\end{DndTable}
The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below.
\begin{DndTable}{lX}
	Spell or item  		& Charges Lost\\
	Disintegrate		& 1d12\\
	Horn of Blasting	& 1d10\\
	Passwall 			& 1d6\\
	Prismatic Spray		& 1d20\\
	Wall of Fire		& 1d4
\end{DndTable}
