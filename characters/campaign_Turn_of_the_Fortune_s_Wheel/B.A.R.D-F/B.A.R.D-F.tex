		{B.A.R.D-F is a formidable construct, built with precision and strength to guard the gate between Mechanus and the}{Nine Hells. His metallic frame is forged from polished steel and reinforced with dark bronze, designed to withstand relentless assaults. His glowing blue eyes are steady and vigilant, scanning for any signs of intrusion. Durable joints and reinforced plating ensure resilience in battle, while his integrated weaponry hints at deadly efficiency. A faint hum emanates from his core, a reminder of the immense power contained within.}
	}%
\Characterbackground{
	In Mechanus, the Battle-Adapted Resonance Droid (B.A.R.D) series was forged to defend against a planar invasion from the Nine Hells. Designed to disorient foes with devastating sonic resonance, the B.A.R.D units were Mechanus' vanguard. Among them, B.A.R.D-F, a small, under-equipped model, was mockingly nicknamed B.A.R.D-Failure for his lack of combat prowess.

	When the infernal horde overwhelmed the first line of defence, nearly all B.A.R.D units were destroyed. B.A.R.D-F, unnoticed in the chaos, fled to the Outlands. Stranded and purposeless, he met a band of travelling outsiders who encouraged him to turn his resonant abilities toward music and storytelling instead of war.

	Eventually, he found his way to Sigil, the City of Doors, where he honed his bardic craft, weaving songs of the war at the gates and the bravery of his fallen kin. Now, B.A.R.D-F strives to forge a new purpose as a storyteller and performer, proving that even a so-called failure can find harmony in the multiverse.
}
\AlliesAndOrganizations{
	The Nine Hells Gate Watch is a formidable and ancient order tasked with safeguarding the precarious portal between Mechanus and the Nine Hells, a junction where the relentless logic of Mechanus collides with the chaotic infernal fires. The gate is an artifact of immense power, blending intricate mechanical precision with volatile, fiery energies. The Gate Watch's primary mission is to prevent the Nine Hells from exploiting this portal to invade Mechanus, ensuring that the plane of pure order remains untainted by infernal chaos. The Gate Watch is predominantly composed of constructs forged in the workshops\linebreak
}{
	of Mechanus itself, each crafted with meticulous care to embody unwavering loyalty, discipline, and strength. These constructs are impervious to the corrupting influence of the Nine Hells, making them ideal sentinels for such a critical and dangerous task.
}
\OrganizationName{Nine Hells Gate Watch}
\OrganizationSymbol{images/Mechanus-Nine_Hells_Gate_Watch.png}
\AdditionalFeaturesAndTraits{
	B.A.R.D-F's metal plating is marked by scratches and dents, each one a relic of his escape from the infernal onslaught and the years of wandering that followed. A reddish-gold patina resembling rust covers his frame, giving him a strangely beautiful, weathered appearance, as though he is a relic of both war and artistry.

His voice carries its own peculiar charm, often mimicking the tone, pitch, or rhythm of those around him, an unintended quirk that frequently catches others off guard. Despite the visible wear and tear he carries, B.A.R.D-F is meticulous in caring for his resonance sensor, polishing it nightly with reverence, treating it as both a vital tool and a sacred part of his identity.

Social interaction remains a challenge for him. His formal greetings, such as "Salutations, organic compatriot of indeterminate origin!" often leave others bemused, while his frequent references to Mechanus idioms - like "Order through resonance!" or "The perfect beat brings clarity" - further add to his eccentric charm.
}
\Treasure{
	\textbf{1. Cursed Ring} A sleek, tarnished silver band embedded with a faintly glowing, tiny crystalline shard that hums softly when touched. Found during the invasion at the planar gates by B.A.R.D-F it is the only memoriam he has from his old life. Once donned, the ring causes sharp, stabbing pain when removal is attempted, almost as if it resists leaving him.\\
	\textbf{2. Harmonic Tuning Fork} A tuning fork engraved with intricate patterns that seem to shimmer in the light. It was gifted to him by a bard in Sigil who admired his abilities.\\
	\textbf{3. Scroll of Unfinished Verse} A crumpled parchment covered in half-written lyrics and cryptic symbols. The words rearrange slightly whenever it's read, as if searching for the perfect rhyme.
}

% PERSONALITY TRAITS
\PersonalityTraits{
	\textbf{Self-Deprecating Humour} B.A.R.D-F often jokes about his "failure" status, making quips about his small frame or lack of combat prowess to put others at ease. Though his humour is endearing, it hides a deeper insecurity about his worth.
}
\Alignment{Lawful Neutral}

\Ideals{
	\textbf{Harmony} "Conflict may start with discord, but resolution comes through harmony - whether in music or life."
}

\Bonds{
	\textbf{The Outlander Troupe} The band of travellers who first showed him acceptance are like family to him, though he hasn't seen them in years.
}

\Flaws{
	\textbf{Fear of Combat} Having witnessed the annihilation of his kin, B.A.R.D-F freezes up in life-or-death situations, questioning his ability to fight.

\subsection*{College of Valor}
Bards of the College of Valor are daring storytellers whose tales preserve the memory of the great heroes of the past. These Bards sing the deeds of the mighty n vaulted halls or to crowds gathered around great bonfires. They travel to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of these events doesn't pass away. With their songs, they inspire new generations to reach the same height of accomplishment as the heroes of old.
\subsubsection*{Combat Inspiration}
You can use your wit to turn the tide of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can use it for one of the following effects.
\paragraph*{Defense} When the creature is hit by an attack roll, that creature can use its Reaction to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss.
\paragraph*{Offense} Immediately after the creature hits a target with an attack roll, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the attack's damage against the target.
\subsubsection*{Martial Training}
You gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor and Shields.

In addition, you can use a Simple or Martial weapon as a Spellcasting Focus to cast spells from your Bard spell list.

  {V}

One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant melody in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw.

The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration or until you or your allies deal damage to the target.
