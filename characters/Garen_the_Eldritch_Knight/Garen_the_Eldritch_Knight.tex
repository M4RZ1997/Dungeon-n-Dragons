\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{Mountain Dwarf Traits}
\subsection*{Darkvision}
Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shade of gray.
\subsection*{Dwarven Resilience}
You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
\subsection*{Dwarven Combat Training}
You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.
\subsection*{Dwarven Armor Training}
You have proficiency with light and medium armor
\subsection*{Stonecunning}
Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead your normal proficiency bonus.

\section*{Fighter Traits}
\subsection*{Fighting Style (Defense)}
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
\subsection*{Second Wind}
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
\subsection*{Action Surge}
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

\section*{Warlock Traits}
\subsection*{Otherworldly Patron (The Hexblade)}
\subsubsection*{Expanded Spell List}
The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.
\begin{DndTable}[header=Law Domain Spells]{lX}
\textbf{Spell Level}  	&\textbf{Spells}						\\
1st						&Shield, Wrathful Smite					\\
2nd						&Blur, Branding Smite					\\
3rd						&Blink, Elemental Weapon				\\
4th						&Phantasmal Killer, Staggering Smite	\\
5th						&Banishing Smite, Cone of Cold			\\
\end{DndTable}
\subsubsection*{Hexblade's Curse}
Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on someone. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. The curse ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item You gain a bonus to damage rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
	\item Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.
	\item If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).
\end{itemize}
You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
\subsubsection*{Hex Warrior}
At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

The influence of your patron also allows you to mystically channel your will through a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Pact of the Blade feature, this benefit extends to every pact weapon you conjure with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.
