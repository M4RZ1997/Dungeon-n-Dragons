\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{Halfling Traits}
\subsection*{Lucky}
When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.
\subsection*{Brave}
You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
\subsection*{Halfling Nimbleness}
You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
\subsection*{Stout Resilience}
You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

\section*{Feats}
\subsection*{Grappler}
\paragraph*{Prerequisite} Strength 13 or higher\\
You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close--quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
	\item You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.
	\item You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Primitive Tribe}
You come from a primitive tribe that has had no interaction with 'modern' civilization. Nearly everything is new to you. Things that everyone else takes for granted are fascinating to you at least at first. You ask dumb questions though sometimes these questions are actually very smart because you ask about things that no one else questions. You generally do things the wrong way (for example putting on armor) until someone shows you how to do them. However you are also attuned to things of nature that other people don't notice.
\subsection*{Languages}
You learn 100 new words per month. You may also learn to read and write in six months.
\subsection*{Tension Sense}
You are attuned to the sounds of the creatures in the natural environment around you. You can tell when there is danger, or something unnatural going on, because you can sense the tension in the environment around you.

Tension sense does not work in a city, castle, town, dungeon, or open ocean (but it does work in a village or isolated tower).

\section*{Barbarian Traits}
\subsection*{Rage}
\newcommand{\RageModifier}{2}
\textbf{Rages: 2}\\
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

\begin{itemize}
	\item You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
	\item When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +\RageModifier ~bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.
	\item You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
\end{itemize}

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.
\subsection*{Unarmored Defense}
While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.\\
\textbf{Armor Class: \intcalcAdd{10}{\intcalcAdd{\calculateModifier{\DexterityScoreValue}}{\calculateModifier{\ConstitutionScoreValue}}}}
\subsection*{Reckless Attack}
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
\subsection*{Danger Sense}
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.
\subsection*{Path of the Totem Warrior}
The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.

Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.
\subsubsection*{Spirit Seeker}
Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the Beast Sense and Speak with Animals spells, but only as rituals.
\subsubsection*{Totem Spirit}
\textbf{Chosen Totem Spirit: Bear}\\
At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object – an amulet or similar adornment – that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.

Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.

\paragraph*{Bear} While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

\section*{Spells}
The barbarian can only cast spells as rituals. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level.

\subsection*{Cantrip}

\DndSpellHeader
  {Beast Sense}
  {2nd Level Divination (Ritual)}
  {1 Action}
  {Touch}
  {S}
  {Concentration, up to 1 hour}

You touch a willing beast. For the duration of the spell, you can use your action to see through the beast’s eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses.

\DndSpellHeader
  {Speak with Animals}
  {1st Level Divination (Ritual)}
  {1 Action}
  {Self}
  {V, S}
  {10 minutes}

You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM’s discretion.

\section*{Miscellaneous}
\subsection*{Atlatl (Ranged, Exotic)}
\textbf{Javelin, Range (90/240)}\\
The atlatl is a tool that uses leverage to achieve greater velocity in projectile-throwing. It may consist of a shaft with a cup or a spur at the end that supports and propels the butt of the ammunition. It is held in one hand, gripped near the end farthest from the cup. The projectile is thrown by the action of the upper arm and wrist. The throwing arm together with the atlatl acts as a lever.

The atlatl will use either darts, javelins, or spears as ammunition. The atlatl will be designed to work with only one of these, and cannot be used with the other types of ammunition.

The effect of using an atlatl is that the short range is tripled, the long range is doubled, and damage is increased. Also, different to other ranged weapon, the user will use the Strength modifier for to-hit rolls and damage rolls.
