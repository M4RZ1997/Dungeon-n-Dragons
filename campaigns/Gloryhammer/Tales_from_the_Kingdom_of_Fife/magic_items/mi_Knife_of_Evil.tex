\section*{Appearance}
{\entryfont The Knife of Evil is a menacing short blade, forged from hyperquenched cryofluid. Its wavy, serpentine form enhances its sinister allure, with a dark blue surface, nearly black, that shimmers with mesmerizing green and purple highlights, as if alive with otherworldly energy, all held in a chilling anti-telharsic forcefield. The blade tapers to an impossibly sharp, otherworldly point, exuding an aura of lethal precision. Its handle, crafted from Primordial Infinitum, is entirely black and textured to resemble the scaly body of a dragon, its surface cold and unyielding. Faint, arcane sigils etched into the handle pulse subtly, as though the weapon itself is awake and watching.}

\section*{History}
{\entryfont Forged in the unfathomable depths of time, the Knife of Evil is one of the legendary Three Relics of Legends, alongside the Hammer of Glory and the Vorpal Laserblaster of Pittenweem. These relics were wielded in 10,000 BD by the Starlords to vanquish an unnamed but incomprehensibly powerful evil. In their victory, the Starlords recognized the immense danger of the relics' combined power. To protect them from falling into the wrong hands, they descended to Earth, choosing the rugged, mystical land of Caledonia - modern-day Scotland - as the hiding place for these artifacts of immense power.

The Knife of Evil was concealed deep within the eerie swamps of Paisley. Whether it was deliberately placed there or accidentally lost during its transport to secrecy remains unknown. The swamp's murky waters and perpetual mists shrouded the knife in mystery, ensuring it remained undisturbed for millennia. However, the knife's malevolent aura could not be forever contained. In 865 AD, it was discovered by Zargothrax, a shadowy figure of dark intentions. Whether drawn to its power by fate or sheer chance, Zargothrax claimed the Knife of Evil, unleashing its dark potential and setting into motion events that would shake the foundations of the world.}

\section*{Magic}
{\entryfont The Knife of Evil wields a terrifying and intricate magical mechanism, rooted in arcane physics and infernal energy. When the blade is stabbed into a target, the act of physical momentum flux activates a complex process within the blade's core. The hyperquenched cryofluid begins to generate a subatomic spin, known as a "quantum turbine," creating an immense energy flow within the knife.

This quantum turbine interacts with the boundary layer between the cryofluid and the anti-telharsic forcefield, inducing an electroweak force. This force is perpendicular to both the direction of thrusting and the alignment of the 7th dimension, where the telharsic field's influence manifests. This multidimensional interaction resolves into a horrifying outcome - non-Euclidean vectors are transformed into an energy pulse that breaches the 18th Hell Dimension, opening a microgateway to hell directly within the victim.

The effects are as devastating as they are immediate. Any living being stabbed by the Knife of Evil becomes possessed by the demon spirit of an Elder Hellgod. The victim's physical body is charged with dark, chaotic energies, twisting them into an agent of destruction. They are consumed by a singular, malevolent purpose: to annihilate the forces of Justice. The possession not only destroys the victim's soul but also leaves their surroundings vulnerable to the taint of the 18th Hell Dimension, spreading despair and corruption wherever the knife is used.

In the wrong hands, the Knife of Evil is not just a weapon but a catalyst for unspeakable horrors, capable of tipping the scales of any conflict toward chaos and ruin.}

\subsection*{Gameplay Mechanics}
{\entryfont The Knife of Evil has 5 charges. While holding it, you can use a Bonus Action to expend 1 of its charges when you hit a creature with this weapon and had advantage on the roll when you made the attack or dealt a Critical Hit in any way. The creature will be immediately possessed by an Elder Hellgod and will be hostile to any forces of Justice. The knife will regain all charges daily at dawn.}
