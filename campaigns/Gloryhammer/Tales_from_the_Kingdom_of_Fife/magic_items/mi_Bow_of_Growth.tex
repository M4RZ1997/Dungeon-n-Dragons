\subsection*{Gameplay Mechanics}
{\entryfont
\subsubsection*{Dormant State}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The wielder gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
	\item When firing an arrow from this weapon, the wielder can declare an \textbf{Oracle Shot}, allowing them to project their sight through the arrow they fire for up to 10 minutes. The ability cannot be used again until the next short rest.
	\item When a creature is killed by an arrow from this weapon, a single six-foot tree rapidly grows out of their corpse over the next minute.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Awaken}
\subsubsection*{Awakened State}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to a +2.
	\item When the wielder hits with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an additional 1d4 Poison damage.
	\item When the wielder hits with an attack, they can declare a \textbf{Bramble Shot}. The target takes an additional 3d8 Piercing damage and must make a \textbf{DC 15 Strength Saving Throw} or become restrained by the suddenly sprouting steel-hard thorn brambles that immediately grow from the arrow. The restrained target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This ability cannot be used again until the wielder finishes a short or long rest.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph*{Exalt}
\subsubsection*{Exalted State}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to a +3.
	\item The Poison damage dealt by attacks with this weapon increases to 1d6.
	\item The wielder can use the \textbf{Bramble Shot} ability twice between rests, and the Saving Throw DC increases to 17.
\end{itemize}}
