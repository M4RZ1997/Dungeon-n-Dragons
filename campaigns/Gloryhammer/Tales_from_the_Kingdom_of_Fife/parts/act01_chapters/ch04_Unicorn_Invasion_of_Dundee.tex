\chapter*{Unicorn Invasion of Dundee}\stepcounter{chapter}\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Unicorn Invasion of Dundee}
\DndDropCapLine{F}{\entryfont lea-ridden bedding, creaking floorboards, and the lingering odour of stale ale and mildew - the deplorable conditions of within the Braided Unicorn are not suited for a good-nights rest. Any character who sleeps there automatically gains one level of exhaustion.}

{\entryfont Elves, constructs, and those who secured private lodging may attempt a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to resist the effects. If an elf or construct enjoyed the comfort of a private room, they make this saving throw with advantage.}

\begin{DndReadAloud}
	Your restless slumber is shattered by a deafening explosion that rocks the tavern. The ground trembles beneath you, and dust fills the air as distant screams echo through the chaos. A blinding flash outside is followed by a crack of thunder, and you see fireballs raining down from the skies.

	Through the grimy window, you glimpse a scene of pure carnage. Blackened plumes of smoke coil into the dawn sky as undead soldiers march through the flaming streets. Among them, corrupted unicorns charge through the chaos, killing and mauling the unfortunate and defenceless townsfolk.

	Another explosion shakes the tavern, and from downstairs, the frantic voice of the barkeep cries out: \textit{"They're here! The monsters are here! We're doomed!"}
\end{DndReadAloud}

\begin{DndOptionalRule}{Hasty Departure}\label{or:HastyDeparture}%
	When the party is abruptly roused by chaos in the Braided Unicorn, they may flee in haste, leaving behind non-essential adventuring gear such as rations and backpacks. They retain only their equipped items, quest essentials, gold, and perhaps a few potions.
\end{DndOptionalRule}

\section*{The Last Stand}\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The Last Stand}
{\entryfont The barkeeper frantically urges the party to help barricade the tavern's two windows and the front door against the oncoming undead horde.

Each window requires two party members working together. A window will be successfully barricaded if the players succeed twice before failing twice during this skill challenge. For example, a players can make a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check (or use appropriate tool proficiencies such as Carpenter's Tools).

If at least one window is successfully barricaded no undead will break through it on Turn 2. If both are successfully barricaded also on Turn 4 no new undead will appear.}
\subsection*{Encounter: Fight to Survive}
{\entryfont This encounter resembles a Monster Rush:
\paragraph*{Enemies} 2 \hyperref[monster:UndeadSoldier]{\LinkFont{Undead Soldiers}} appear at the start of the encounter. On initiative count 20 of each round after the first, 2 more undeads will breach through windows. At the start of the 3rd turn additionally a \hyperref[monster:CorruptedUnicorn]{\LinkFont{Unicorn}} will breach through the barricaded door and attack the barkeep. On initiative count 20 of the 5th turn the tavern is obliterated by a fireball, killing everyone within the tavern.
\paragraph*{End of Battle} The only goal is to flee through the tunnel beyond the trap door, pointed out by the barkeeper shortly before he is mauled and beheaded by the unicorn. As soon as all players reached the trap door the battle ends and the tavern is obliterated above them.}

\section*{The Fall of Dundee}\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The Fall of Dundee}
{\entryfont Moments after the party enters the tunnel, a fireball crashes into the tavern above, obliterating the structure with a deafening roar. The tunnel shakes as debris collapses behind them, sealing the exit and forcing them forward towards the unknown.}

\begin{DndReadAloud}
	Emerging from the tunnel, you step into a scene of chaos and despair. The acrid stench of smoke fills your lungs, and the sky above burns with fire and crackling lightning. Flames consume the nearby buildings, casting flickering light over the main plaza of Dundee, now a battleground. Soldiers of the kingdom and a few desperate citizens fight valiantly, but they are hopelessly outnumbered by the relentless undead soldiers and grotesque, corrupted unicorns. The screams of the dying echo all around, mixing with the roars of undead beasts and the clash of steel.
	
	At the heart of the plaza, you see a familiar figure: King Dundax \RoyalRoman{XIII}, a golden figure in the darkness. His shining armor reflects the fiery glow of the battlefield as he duels several undead soldiers. With every swing of his blade, he fells another foe, standing as a beacon of courage amidst the carnage. For a fleeting moment, hope flickers in your hearts.
	
	But then it happens!

	A corrupted unicorn, its rotting flesh gleaming wetly and its glowing, jagged horn crackling with dark energy, bursts through the melee. With terrifying speed, it lowers its head and charges. The king barely has time to turn before the horn pierces through his golden breastplate, the force lifting him off the ground.

	Time seems to freeze as King Dundax \RoyalRoman{XIII}, the proud ruler of the Kingdom of Fife, collapses to the bloodstained cobblestones. His crown falls, rolling a few feet before stopping at the hooves of the monstrous beast.

	Around you, the battle continues, but it is clear: the heart of the kingdom has just been torn away. This is not just the fall of a city - it may well be the end of Fife itself.
\end{DndReadAloud}

\subsection*{Encounter: The King is Dead}
{\entryfont The corrupted unicorn and two undead soldiers that felled King Dundax \RoyalRoman{XIII} notice the party. With bloodlust in their hollow, glowing eyes, the creatures pivot from their prior target and focus on the adventurers. The undead soldiers advance in a disciplined formation, shields raised and weapons ready, while the corrupted unicorn lets out a bone-chilling, unnatural whinny, pawing the ground as it prepares to charge. The party has no choice but to fight for their survival amidst the chaos of the main plaza.

\paragraph*{Enemies} 2 \hyperref[monster:UndeadSoldier]{\LinkFont{Undead Soldiers}}, 1 \hyperref[monster:CorruptedUnicorn]{\LinkFont{Corrupted Unicorn}} (47 HP, no Teleport)

\paragraph*{Tactics} The undead soldiers will engage in combat first, aiming to tie up melee combatants while the unicorn uses its mobility to keep the party under pressure. The unicorn may charge at a spellcaster or ranged attacker after observing the battlefield.

\paragraph*{Support} If a player is hit by the Charge Attack or is hit by any attack while at 5 HP or below, \hyperref[char:SerProletius]{\LinkFont{Ser Proletius}} and \hyperref[char:AngusMcFife]{\LinkFont{Prince Angus McFife}} appear to help the party in the battle. Ser Proletius will charge in front of the attacked player and use his Divine Allegiance feature to take the hit instead. During the fight Ser Proletius heals the party members and protects them, while Prince Angus McFife fights along with them.

\paragraph*{End of Battle} If the unicorn is below 10 HP or both Undead Soldiers are dead, the battle will end and the evil wizard Zargothrax will appear (continue reading).
}
\section*{Unholy Coronation}\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The Unholy Coronation}
{\entryfont The evil wizard Zargothrax, clad in robes of dark energy, makes his entrance atop a massive undead unicorn. His arrival heralds the city's fall, as fear and despair grip the defenders. The party witnesses his terrifying entrance, setting the stage for his declaration as the dark master of Dundee.}
\begin{DndReadAloud}
	A sudden chill grips the air, and the battlefield falls eerily silent for a fleeting moment, as though the city itself is holding its breath. Then, from above, a shadow spreads across Dundee, dark and foreboding.
	
	Through the smoke and fire, a figure emerges atop a towering, undead unicorn of war. The creature's skeletal form crackles with violet energy, its empty eye sockets burning with an eerie, unholy light. It moves with an unnatural grace, its very presence pressing down upon the battlefield like an unspoken command to submit. The few remaining defenders shrink back, their weapons trembling in unsteady hands.

	The unicorn's hooves land upon the bloodied stones of the plaza, sending a ripple of necrotic energy through the ground. A silence falls, not of peace, but of resignation - of finality. Then, a voice cuts through the air, cold and commanding, laced with dark amusement and absolute authority.

	\textit{"People of Dundee! Your king is dead. Your city is mine. Kneel before me, and perhaps I will grant you the mercy of undeath."}
	
	For a moment, the battlefield stands frozen, the weight of the proclamation hanging like a curse over the ruined city. Then - Ewan MacRae, bloodied but unbroken, charges through the haze of battle, sword raised high. His face is set with unshaken determination as he rushes toward the figure atop the undead steed.
	
	\textit{"FOR DUN-"}
	
	But before he can close the distance, he jerks violently mid-stride - his body convulsing as an unseen force seizes him. His sword clatters to the ground - he collapses onto the cobblestone, lifeless. No wounds mark his body. His charge ended in an instant, his final words forever unfinished.
	
	\textit{"PATHETIC MORTAL SCUM! KILL THEM ALL! FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, I, LORD ZARGOTHRAX, RULE DUNDEE!"}
	
	With these words, the sky, once pitch-black, erupts into an inferno of searing light, as if the heavens themselves burn in response to his unholy coronation.
\end{DndReadAloud}

{\noindent\entryfont The inferno in the sky is no natural phenomenon - it is a devastating barrage of fireballs, cascading down upon Dundee like the wrath of a vengeful god. The battle is over. There is no victory to be found here.}

\section*{Flee Certain Death}\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Flee Certain Death}
{\entryfont As the destruction unfolds and the undead army overruns the last defences, Ser Proletius and Prince Angus McFife waste no time in shouting above the chaos - Dundee is lost. The city and townsfolk were not ready for war. To stay is to die. With no other choice, they urge the party towards the River Tay Bridge, the only remaining escape route.}

\subsection*{Navigating the Burning Ruins}

\subsection*{Pass the Undead Horde}
\begin{DndReadAloud}
	As you navigate the war-torn streets of Dundee, you see a group of undead soldiers cut down fleeing townsfolk. Beyond the carnage, the River Tay Bridge stands, but to reach it, you must find a way past these relentless killers... or cut through them.
\end{DndReadAloud}

Angus McFife and Ser Proletius can join the battle. On Initiative Count 20 on Turn 5 reinforcements (2 \hyperref[monster:UndeadSoldier]{\LinkFont{Undead Soldiers}} and 1 \hyperref[monster:CorruptedUnicorn]{\LinkFont{Unicorn}}) will arrive - Turn 4 if the party failed to sneak past the horde.}

\subsection*{The Final Sprint over the Bridge}
\begin{DndReadAloud}
	As you near the River Tay Bridge, fireballs hammer the ancient stonework, sending tremors through the ground as chunks of masonry crumble into the raging waters below. The entire structure groans under the assault, shaking violently beneath your feet.

	From ahead, Ser Proletius and Prince Angus McFife turn back, their eyes wide with urgency.

	\textit{"MOVE NOW! RUN!"}

	A deafening crack splits the air as another fireball slams into the bridge. The supports buckle. The path behind you is collapsing.

	There is not much time to make it across...

	\item \textbf{Acrobatics (DC 13):} For the agile, weaving through debris and leaping across collapsing sections of stone (Acrobatics Skill Proficiency required).
	\item \textbf{Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 16):} For those untrained in either skill, relying purely on instinct to react fast enough to avoid falling rubble and crumbling pathways.
\end{itemize}}
\vfill\eject
\subsubsection*{Outcome}
{\entryfont If a character fails their check, the Degree-of-Failure (DoF) - the difference between their roll and the DC - will dictate the consequences.}
\paragraph*{Success}
{\entryfont The Player crosses the bridge exhausted but unscathed.}
\paragraph*{Failure (DoF max 5)}
{\entryfont The Player takes \DndDice{1d6} fire damage, but makes it across - if not dropped to 0 hit points.}
\paragraph*{Failure (DoF > 5)}
{\entryfont The Player falls as the bridge crumbles beneath their feet. They must make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity Saving Throw or fall 80 feet into the river Tay - most likely killing them instantly.}

\section*{A Horrendous View}\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{A Horrendous View}

{\entryfont The party finds themselves on the banks of the River Tay, breathless and shaken. Behind them, the bridge has collapsed, sealing their escape and leaving behind the burning ruins of Dundee. Across the river, where once stood a proud and thriving city, now only devastation remains. Smoke and fire rise into the sky, casting an eerie glow over the shattered buildings - a grim testament to the apocalyptic destruction that unfolded.}

\begin{DndReadAloud}
	As you stand on the muddy banks of the River Tay, the weight of what just transpired settles heavily upon you. Across the water, Dundee is no more. The once-great city, its spires and halls that once shone in the golden light, is now a smoldering ruin. Smoke curls into the sky like grasping fingers, and fires rage unchecked, their glow reflected in the darkened waters of the river. The echoes of distant screams and the collapsing of buildings still carry across the wind, a final whisper of the city's last breath.

	Beside you, Ser Proletius and Prince Angus McFife stand motionless, their eyes fixed on the ruins before them. Proletius, his armour still scarred from battle, grips his sword so tightly his knuckles turn white, his usually unshakable demeanour fractured by the horror of what he has just witnessed.

	Angus McFife stares in disbelief, his face pale, his lips parted as if to speak - but no words come. His city, his people, his home... all lost. His breath quickens as his eyes scan around the few survivors, searching, hoping for a glimpse of something - of someone. But there is no sign of Iona McDougall.

	His shoulders tense, his hands balling into fists. A new fire ignites in his eyes - not the flickering glow of sorrow, but the burning heat of vengeance. He grits his teeth, his voice shaking but firm as he finally speaks:

	\textit{"I will make Zargothrax die!"}

	The wind howls across the river, carrying with it the embers of a fallen kingdom. The city of Dundee is lost, but the fire of revenge has just been lit.
