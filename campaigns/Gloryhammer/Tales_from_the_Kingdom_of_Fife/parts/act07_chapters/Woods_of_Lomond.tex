\DndDropCapLine{I}{\entryfont n the heart of Fyfe lies the Woods of Lomond, a vast and brooding forest shrouded in mystery. Its dense, shadowed canopy discourages all but the most foolhardy from venturing within, and few who do ever return. Whispers tell of a hidden elven tribe dwelling deep among the trees, unseen and uninterested in the affairs of nearby villages. Stranger tales speak of curious creatures haunting the forest's edges, and of wanderers who vanish without trace - neither bodies nor belongings ever found, as if swallowed by another realm. On rare occasions, someone emerges claiming to have grown up in the Woods, yet their memories are fragmented, elusive, and often dismissed as fanciful lies.}

Unable to return, the Caelthir carved out a hidden existence in the uninhabited forest, shunning the ways of the mortal world that they view as crude and corrupt. Yet the boundary between realms remains unstable - stray portals still flare open in the woods, spilling forth creatures from the Feywild, some benign, many perilous. The Caelthir devote themselves to understanding these rifts, seeking the key to their lost home, though among the younger generations a different sentiment has taken root: to embrace the Woods of Lomond as their new world, even if it was never meant to be.}
