	{\noindent\entryfont Prince Angus McFife I stands just over six feet tall, his posture regal yet relaxed, as if he'd rather be wandering the emerald hills of Fife than presiding over court. Clear blue eyes - reflecting both compassion and resolute courage - scan his surroundings constantly, ever alert for his people or a creature in need. He favours a studded leather armour of deep forest green, embroidered with silver filigree.

	Born the eldest son of King Dundax \RoyalRoman{XIII}, Angus was raised in princely halls of Dundee but still keep his humility and kindness towards the people of Fife. His voice is warm and low, each word chosen with gentle precision; when he laughs - a rich, infectious sound - it feels like sunlight breaking through canopy leaves.

	On the battlefield, Angus takes his place at the vanguard, sword aloft and voice carrying above clashing steel. His keen tactical mind discerns enemy\\weaknesses and with an\\incomparable commanding\\presence, he bolsters his\\forces' fortitude and\\resilience.\\\vspace*{-2.5\fontdimen6\font}}
	\begin{DndComment}{Playing Angus McFife}
		When portraying Prince Angus McFife I, lean into his compassionate nature. Speak with a soft, calm tone and allow him to interrupt formalities if he senses distress. Showcase his humility by having him downplay compliments and share credit with others. In moments of conflict, shift seamlessly from gentle peacemaker to determined protector. Above all, let his kindness be his strongest weapon - one that inspires allies and tames even the most hardened hearts.

\subsection{Alasdair MacLeod}\label{char:AlasdairMacLeod}
{\entryfont Alasdair MacLeod hails from the rugged slopes of the Glencoe Mountains, where his Stone-Goliath clan tests their mettle by hurling ancient granite boulders off towering cliffs. He enters Dundee's wedding tourney not for mere sport, but to prove that his people's hard-won strength from the Highlands still commands respect across Caledonia.}

\subsection{Ewan MacRae of Dunkeld}\label{char:EwanMacRae}
{\entryfont Ewan MacRae stands as Dunkeld's unyielding bulwark, born and raised on the misty banks of the River Tay where he learned swordplay guarding abbey walls and herding cattle through Highland glens. Clad in steel plate etched with the symbol of Dunkeld's fallen heroes, he has repelled raiders and settled feuds with unshakeable discipline. Now, as the clear favourite of Dundee's wedding tourney, Ewan seeks not only personal glory but to elevate his town's renown - victory would cement Dunkeld's reputation as a bastion of strength and honour throughout Scotland.}

\subsection{Gavin Buchanan}\label{char:GavinBuchanan}
{\entryfont Gavin Buchanan is a nimble halfling rogue from Dundee's bustling harbour district, where he learned to ghost through alleyways and lift purses with a rakish grin. His keen green eyes spot every coin pouch and councilor's secret, and his leather jerkin hides tools for any trick. In the wedding tourney, he aims to prove that wit and speed can outmatch steel - and maybe pocket a few unexpected prizes along the way.}

\subsection{Hamish "Halfwit" McGregor}\label{char:HamishMcGregor}
{\entryfont Hamish "Halfwit" McGregor strides into the lists as Dundee's most infamous human bard, lute slung crooked over one shoulder and mismatched armour clinking with every off-key chord. Hailing from the city's poorest quarter, his performances are as chaotic as his swordplay - he mangles melodies, forgets lyrics, and somehow still manages to rally a crowd's laughter. Nobody's quite sure how he earned a spot in the wedding tourney - some say it's for sheer entertainment - but Hamish embraces the role, blundering through verse and verse until even his foes can't help but chuckle at his well-meaning, bumbling charm.}

\subsection{Rory MacTavish}\label{char:RoryMacTavish}
{\entryfont Rory MacTavish slips into the tournament grounds like a shadow at dusk - tall and lithe, clad in muted forest greens and a cloak of whispering leaves. A Wood Elf by race, he speaks little of his past: no village name, no childhood tales, only the silent precision of his arrows and the watchful calm in his emerald eyes. With each draw of his longbow, he betrays a lifetime's practice among ancient woodlands, yet his true purpose here remains as hidden as his footsteps in the undergrowth. Whether he seeks challenge, redemption, or something none can guess, Rory's inscrutable presence keeps both allies and rivals on edge.}
