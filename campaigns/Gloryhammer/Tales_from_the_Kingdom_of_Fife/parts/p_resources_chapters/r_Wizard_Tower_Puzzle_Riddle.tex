			Behind the gears where secrets lie,\\
			Turn rings until two shapes meet eye.\\

			Then to the forest's hushed domain,\\
			Focus on each glowing sign again -\\
			Trace scattered shafts and scattered blades,\\
			And heed the bones in shaded glades.\\
		\end{center}
		\begin{center}
			These lines you draw will make three keys,\\
			Yet only one in from the center sees.\\
		\end{center}
		\begin{center}
			Once those numbers claim your hands,\\
			Arrange the weapons as fate demands -\\
			From weakest chip to mightiest swing,\\
			Let their damage order be the thing.\\
		\end{center}
		\begin{center}
			Set the stelae so each rune shows true,\\
			Let ancient magic then awaken anew.\\
			Strike the crystal with a sorcerous blow,\\
			And in a pulse you're within the Arcanum's glow.\\
		\end{center}
		\begin{center}
			But stray from the path or twist the code,\\
			And law will claim what you once held bold.
