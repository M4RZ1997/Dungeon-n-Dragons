	\DndMonsterAction{Frightful Presence (Recharge 5-6)}
	Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)}
	The dragon exhales lightning in a 120-Â­foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking \DndDice{16d10} lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	
	\DndMonsterSection{Legendary Actions}
	The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
	\begin{DndMonsterLegendaryActions}
		\DndMonsterLegendaryAction{Detect}{The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.}
		\DndMonsterLegendaryAction{Tail Attack}{The dragon makes a tail attack.}
		\DndMonsterLegendaryAction{Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)}{The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take \DndDice{2d6 + 9} bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.}
