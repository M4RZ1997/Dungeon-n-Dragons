    \DndMonsterAction{Martial Advantage}
	Once per turn, the soldier can deal an extra \DndDice{2d6} damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the soldier that isn't incapacitated.
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Undead Fortitude}
	If damage reduces the undead soldier to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Undead Nature}
	The undead doesn't require food, air, drink, or sleep.
