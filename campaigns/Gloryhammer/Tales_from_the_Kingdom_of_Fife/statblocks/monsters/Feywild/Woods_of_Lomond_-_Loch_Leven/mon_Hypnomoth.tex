\chapter*{Hypnomoth}\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Hypnomoth}

\entryfont Within the mystical heart of the Feywild, where reality weaves into enchantment, the Hypnomoth flutters as a living marvel. With wings spanning a meter wide, this wondrous creature dances on the air, its resplendent plumage a dazzling kaleidoscope of colors that defy mortal description. Each wing is a canvas of vibrant hues, intricately adorned with shifting patterns that catch the ambient light and cast shimmering reflections that seem to mirror the very essence of the Feywild itself.

Adorning its head are delicate feelers, like ethereal tendrils of the imagination given form. These adornments quiver and tremble, a sensory extension that captures the enchanting energies of its surroundings. Its six legs end in stingers, a chilling contrast to its bewitching exterior. The stingers gleam like polished daggers, a reminder that beneath the allure lies a creature well-equipped for attack and defense.

The Hypnomoth's flight is a mesmerizing ballet that echoes the harmonious rhythm of the Feywild. It flits through the air with graceful movements, each flutter of its wings a brushstroke upon the canvas of the world. Its presence is a testament to the unbreakable bond between the Feywild's wild magic and the creatures that inhabit it.

\textbf{Colony Gathering} The Hypnomoth makes its home in the heart of the Feywild, where time flows like a river of dreams and the boundaries between reality and imagination blur. It favors the vibrant glades, enchanting meadows, and luminous forests that characterize this realm, where it finds sustenance amidst the Feywild's natural beauty.

While the Hypnomoth is often encountered alone, there are whispered tales of ephemeral gatherings, like moonlit masquerades where these creatures flit and flutter together in dances that are both beguiling and mysterious. These gatherings are rumored to occur during rare celestial events,\linebreak\hspace*{2em}when the boundaries between the Feywild and the\linebreak\hspace*{3.5em}Material Plane are at their thinnest.

	The Hypnomoth emits an enchanting aura within 30 feet of it. Creatures that start their turn in the aura and can see the Hypnomoth must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. A charmed creature is incapacitated and oblivious to danger while charmed. The effect ends if the charmed creature takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it out of the trance.

	\DndMonsterAction{Color Burst (Recharge 5-6)}
	The Hypnomoth emits an explosion of numerous Radiant Darts, emerging from the Hypnomoth's wings in a 60 foot cone. Each creature in the area of effect must make a DC 14 Dexterity Saving Throw taking \DndDice{5d8} radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  After the Hypnomoth takes this action, it transforms into the Shade version of the Hypnomoth. The hit points and all conditions - except of being poisoned - persist during the form change.

	\DndMonsterAction{Ethereal Siphon}
	The Hypnomoth gains a Color counter each time it successfully uses its Chromavore ability. When its Color counter reaches a number equal to its Challenge Rating, it transforms back into the Colorful version of the Hypnomoth.
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Chromavore}
	Whenever the Chromatic Tail Stinger attack hits, the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target's body is drained of color, leaving it visually muted and monochromatic. The target becomes affected by Monochromatism and takes \DndDice{1d8} necrotic damage. The Hypnomoth gains one Color counter.
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Ethereal Cloak}
	The Hypnomoth gains partial incorporeality, allowing it to move through objects and avoid physical harm. Attacks against it that rely on non-magical weapons have disadvantage.

\section*{The Shade's Unveiling}
As the radiant burst reaches its zenith and the darts disperse into the air, a subtle yet profound shift begins to weave its magic. The once-vibrant colors that adorned the Hypnomoth's wings, each a brushstroke of the Feywild's enigmatic palette, start to ebb away. In their wake emerges a spectral pallor, a gossamer cloak of hues that shimmers with a delicate translucence. Each hue fades like the receding echoes of an ancient melody, leaving behind a canvas of twilight beauty.
\vfill\eject
\noindent From within the radiant aftermath\\of the burst and amidst the spectral\\luminescence, the Hypnomoth's\\metamorphosis concludes.\\Emerging from the depths\\of shimmering radiance,\\the creature reveals its\\new incarnation - the\\Shade version of the\\Hypnomoth. The vibrant\\colors that once danced\\upon its wings now yield\\to a pale, ghostly trans-\\lucence, akin to the delicate\\wings of a moth caught\\between moonbeams. Its\\form resonates with an\\enigmatic allure that hints\\at the very essence of the\\Feywild's mysteries.
\\\\
\paragraph*{Behavior and Impact}\hfill\\
The Shade Hypnomoth's\\behavior takes on an otherworldly demeanor.\\It moves with a quiet grace, its wingbeats barely\\audible as it drifts through the air like a specter. Rather than drawing attention with vibrant displays, it maintains a somber elegance, as if acknowledging its altered presence within the realm.

The creature's Chromavore ability reveals its inscrutable nature. Engaging in its unique form of feeding, it drains the color from its foes, leaving them muted and devoid of life's vibrancy. As it gathers these chromatic essences, its own spectral form seems to intensify, as if empowered by the very shades it consumes.

The impact on its environment is both subtle and profound. Creatures within its vicinity often display signs of unease, as if the natural hues around them have dimmed in the Hypnomoth's presence. Vegetation loses a fraction of its lushness, and the world seems to momentarily hold its breath in acknowledgment of the creature's ethereal essence.
\\
\subsubsection*{Effect of Monochromatism}
The absence of vibrant colors and the muted palette detract from a creature's ability to express emotions and intentions through visual cues. This leads to a disadvantage on Charisma-based ability checks, as their communication becomes less engaging and relatable.

Restoring a creature's lost color is no simple feat, as the Chromavore's effects run deeper than mere physical appearance. It requires the performance of the Chromatic Restoration Ritual which utilizes the delicate wings of the Hypnomoth as a key ingredient which must be bathed in moonlight thus restoring the color of the affected partaking in the ritual.
