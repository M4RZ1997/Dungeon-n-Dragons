	    \DndMonsterAction{Winged Armor}
		The Robot Prince of Auchtertool has a flying speed equal to his walking speed. He can use this feature to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If he is flying when the duration expires, he descends at a rate of 30 feet per round until he lands.
		
		The armor regains 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours it isn't in use.
		
		\DndMonsterAction{Dampening Field}
		The Robot Prince of Auchtertool has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.
