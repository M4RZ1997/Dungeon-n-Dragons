		\DndMonsterSection{Traits}
		\DndMonsterAction{Rage}
		While the Rage is active, the Hootsman gains the following benefits:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item He has resistance against bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage
			\item When he makes an attack using Strength, his damage increases by +3
			\item He has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws
		\end{itemize}
		While in Rage, the Hootsman is also immune to the Charmed and Frightened condition and already affecting conditions of that kind end if he enters his Rage.
		Additionally, the Hootsman can make any checks of the following skills as a Strength check: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.
		
		\DndMonsterAction{Feral Instinct}
		The Hootsman has advantage on Initiative Rolls.
		
		\DndMonsterAction{Reckless Attack}
		When the Hootsman makes his first attack roll he can give himself Advantage on it until the next turn, but attack rolls against him have Advantage during that time.
		He can forego the Advantage to deal an additional \DndDice{1d10} damage and either push the target 15 feet and move up to half his Speed towards the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks or reduce the targets speed by 15 feet.
		If the Hootsman's Rage is active when using this trait the target also takes \DndDice{3d6} additional damage of the same type as the attack.
		
		\DndMonsterSection{Actions}
		\DndMonsterAction{Extra Attack}
		The Hootsman can attack twice whenever he takes the Attack Action.
