\paragraph*{Basic Information}
{\entryfont Half-Elf, female, late 30s to early 40s}

\paragraph*{Profession}
{\entryfont Senior Permit Officer, City Infrastructure \& Construction Approvals, Candra Community Center}

\paragraph*{Personality}
{\entryfont Veska Ardani doesn't wait for things to happen - she makes them happen. A towering presence both in stature and attitude, she moves through Candra's community center like she owns the place, because in many ways, she does. Blunt, fearless, and frustratingly confident, she speaks her mind without hesitation, whether calling out corruption or teasing a nervous merchant. She flirts for fun, fights for principle, and never backs down from a challenge.

She doesn't need weapons - her hands are enough. Years of manual labour have made her grip strong enough to make grown adventurers wince. She cracks her knuckles before arguments, smells faintly of sawdust and ink, and can bend bureaucracy like an art form - despite hating it. Her admirers call her charming, but she brushes them off with a smirk, occasionally playing along just to watch them squirm.

Deep down, she cares more than she lets on. She remembers faces, gives brutally honest but oddly wise advice, and if someone truly needs help, she'll grumble - but she'll do it. If anyone tries to stop her? Good luck. Veska Ardani does not take "no" for an answer.}
