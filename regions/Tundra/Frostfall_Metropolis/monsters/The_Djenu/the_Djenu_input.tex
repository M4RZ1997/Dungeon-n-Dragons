\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{The Djenu (Heartfrost)}

\entryfont \noindent \DndDropCapLine{O}ccasionally, an evil spirit will possess a human, turning them into a Djenu. More often, however, a human is turned into a Djenu as a result of such a heinous crime that it is believed one cannot remain human after it is committed.\\\\
This crime? Cannibalism. Yes, almost every Djenu was once a human but with an unholy hunger. Due to this crime, it is said that the heart turns to pure ice, triggering the change from human to monster. Unlike most other evil creatures, though, a Djenu can return to its human form. To do this, the heart must be extracted from its frozen prison. Then the icy heart must be destroyed by being completely melted.\\\\
\textbf{Appearance.} The mere sight of this fiend gives you chill. Its grotesque body is roughly humanoid, but there's nothing human-like about its glistening blue skin or the jagged shards of ice that cling to it like armour. Its posture and size are more like a troll, with sharp claws and razor-sharp teeth.\\\\
The ice cannibal is a formidable opponent who strikes as unexpectedly as a winter storm. When it senses danger, it may encase its opponents in ice, trapping them within its grasp until they are able to break free from the frozen prison. With enough skill and strength, adventurers may face down this beast and survive to tell the tale... enjoy!\\\\

		Djenu were once human, or so they claim, but the darkest sins triggered their change. Consuming another is where it went wrong, a heart in a body that doesn't belong.\\ Returning the soul to what used to be, by melting the prison they wish to be free.%

		Some Djenu have adapted to survive and blend into urban environments. Living underground, avoiding the warmth of the sun, they surface during the harsh winters often disguised as a helpless frozen traveller waiting patiently to pounce.
		\DndMonsterAction{Condition Immunities}
		exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed
		\DndMonsterAction{Innate Spellcasting (3/Day)}
		The Blackheart Djenu can innately cast Armour of Agathys, requiring  no material components. It's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom.
		\DndMonsterAction{Chattering Storm}
		A frozen burst of freezing shards blast from the Djenu in a 15-foot cone. Any creature caught in the spell must make a Constitution saving throw, taking \DndDice{2d8} on a fail, or half as much on a success. Any nonmagical liquid caught within the blast freezes instantly.
