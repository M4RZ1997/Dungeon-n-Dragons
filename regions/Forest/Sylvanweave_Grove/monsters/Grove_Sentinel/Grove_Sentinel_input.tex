\entryfont \noindent \DndDropCapLine{T}he Grove Sentinel, an awe-inspiring embodiment of the primeval forces of nature, emerges from the depths of ancient woodlands. Born from the harmonious union of elemental energy and the essence of venerable trees, this majestic creature stands as the guardian of sacred groves and arboreal realms. Its existence is intrinsically entwined with the delicate equilibrium of the natural world.

As the Grove Sentinel evolves, it manifests in two formidable variants, each with a unique purpose and appearance. The strength-focused variant embodies raw power, growing to towering heights and possessing a robust, muscular frame. Its bark-like skin gains a rugged texture, providing a natural armor that deflects blows and mitigates physical harm. With every swing of its mighty limbs, the Sentinel delivers devastating strikes that reverberate through the earth itself.

In contrast, the defensive armor variant of the Grove Sentinel adopts a role of steadfast protection. Its form expands into a broad, towering figure, encased in an intricately woven exoskeleton of thorny bark. This impenetrable shield grants unparalleled defense, repelling all but the most determined assailants. Within its protective aura, allies find solace, as the Sentinel's presence fortifies their resolve and grants them respite from harm.

Legends speak of the Grove Sentinel's indomitable spirit, its unyielding dedication to preserving the sanctity of ancient woods and sacred glens. Whether facing the onslaught of encroaching civilizations, repelling those who would harm the natural balance, or warding off malevolent forces that seek to corrupt the purity of the forest, the Grove Sentinel stands resolute. Its presence is a testament to the enduring power and wisdom of the primeval woodland, an eternal guardian in a world where nature's balance hangs in delicate equilibrium.

\DndMonsterAction{Earthbound Grasp} Both variants of the Grove Sentinel possess an innate connection to the botanical realm, drawing strength and vitality from the verdant life surrounding them. They can summon the ancient roots and vines that slumber beneath the forest floor, manipulating them with dexterity and purpose. Whether ensnaring foes in a suffocating embrace or weaving an impenetrable network of protective cover for themselves and their allies, the Sentinel's control over nature's verdant tendrils is awe-inspiring to behold.

\DndMonsterAction{Photosynthetic Rejuvenation} In addition to their physical prowess, the Grove Sentinel possesses an inherent ability to heal and regenerate. They draw sustenance from the radiant energy of sunlight, their photosynthetic nature allowing them to recover from injuries and rejuvenate their vitality. Should a Grove Sentinel be on the brink of defeat, it can tap into the life force of the surrounding flora, channeling its energy to revive itself with a surge of renewed vigor.

    \DndMonsterAction{Spellcasting}
    The Grove Sentinel (Sproutling) is a 3rd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The Grove Sentinel has the following druid spells prepared:
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Cantrips (at Will): Druidcraft, Produce Flames, Shillelagh
    	\item 1st Level (4 Slots): Entangle, Longstrider

    \DndMonsterAction{Entangle}
	The Grove Sentinel causes plants in a 15-foot radius centered on a point within 60 feet to come to life and restrain creatures. Each creature within the area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The effect ends if the plants are destroyed (AC 15, 10 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage).

    The Ancient Grove Sentinel emanates a peaceful aura, exuding an air of tranquility and deterring hostile actions. Hostile creatures that start their turn within 30 feet of the Sentinel must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's aggressive tendencies are suppressed, and it is unable to take hostile actions against any creature until the start of its next turn. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Non-hostile creatures are unaffected by this ability.
    
    \DndMonsterAction{Thorned Defense}
    Any creature that hits the Ancient Grove Sentinel with a melee attack while within 15 feet of it takes \DndDice{5d6} piercing damage.
     
    \DndMonsterAction{Resilient Resurgence (1/Day)}
    If the Ancient Grove Sentinel is reduced to 0 hit points and not killed outright, it can tap into the life force of the surrounding flora to revive itself. It regains 50 hit points and immediately returns to the fight.

	\DndMonsterSection{Legendary Actions}
    The Ancient Grove Sentinel can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one Legendary Action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Ancient Grove Sentinel regains spent Legendary Actions at the start of its turn.
    \DndMonsterAction{Thorny Vines}
    The Ancient Grove Sentinel conjures an area of thorny vines within a 20-foot radius centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking \DndDice{3d10} piercing damage and becoming restrained on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    \DndMonsterAction{Rooted Stomp}
    The Ancient Grove Sentinel makes one slam attack. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by entangling roots until the end of its next turn.
    \DndMonsterAction{Unyielding Bulwark (3/Day)}
	The Ancient Grove Sentinel assumes a defensive stance, gaining temporary immunity to critical hits and advantage on saving throws against spells. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until the overgrown bullwark is destroyed (AC 15; 50HP; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, poison, and psychic damage).
    \DndMonsterAction{Regenerative Vitality (Costs 2 Actions)}
    The Ancient Grove Sentinel regains hit points equal to \DndDice{3d10 + 5}. When the Ancient Grove Sentinel is in direct sunlight it regains \DndDice{5d10 + 10} hitpoints instead.
